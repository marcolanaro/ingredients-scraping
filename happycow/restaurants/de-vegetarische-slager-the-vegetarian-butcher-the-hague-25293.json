  "description": "Opened Oct 2010, this store offers a selection of all vegetarian faux meats, like faux chicken, bacon, burger patties, gyros, and sausage -- in addition to other vegetarian and vegan products like imports, Japanese food, and vegan supplies. Today their products are sold throughout the Netherlands. De Vegetarische Slager is the brainchild of eighth-generation lupin farmer Jaap Korteweg, who hopes to restore the protein-rich food to dinner plates in Europe, offering a sustainable alternative to meat while also reducing the environmental impact of rampant soy farming in South America.",
