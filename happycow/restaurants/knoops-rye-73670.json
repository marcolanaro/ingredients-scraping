  "description": "A little shop on the cliff edge of Rye that only sells hot chocolate (and a few cakes, etc). You start by choosing a chocolate base e.g. 65% dark and 8 of the options are vegan. They have 2 vegan milks - soy and almond. You then choose from a very wide range of additional flavors e.g. vanilla paste, lemon zest, sichuan pepper and much, much more.",
