  "description": "Opened in March 2011, this is a specialty gourmet ice cream shop that features hand crafted RAW ice cream, all of which are dairy-free and soy-free. Most flavors are vegan except ones containing honey - just ask. Offers a full menu of treats including waffle sandwich, banana split sundae, fresh juices, smoothies, blended drinks, and cold pressed coffee. The ingredients used are mostly organic, and the to-go ware is biodegradable. Shares the same space as Sage Organic Vegan Bistro.",
