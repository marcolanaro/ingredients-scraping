  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. About one third of the menu at this hotel's restaurant was specifically vegetarian, which is almost unheard of in Iceland outside of Reykjavik. All of their soups are vegetarian. Try the vegetarian steak. Their breakfast offered vegetarians Icelandic yogurt, freshly baked whole grain bread and freshly squeezed fruit juices.",
