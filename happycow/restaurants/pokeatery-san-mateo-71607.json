  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Casual eatery offering Hawaiian style fish bowls but has a veggie bowl with tofu which is priced lower. Could build-your-own bowl. Most of the ingredients (salads, sauces and toppings) are vegan with a few vegetarian and a few fish-based - ask the staff. Uses compostable packaging.",
