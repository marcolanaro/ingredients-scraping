  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Trendy sushi and Japanese food restaurant operating since 2011. Menu includes a section of veggie rolls with around 19 choices - vegans be sure to specify no mayonaise/egg. Note that tempura contains egg and is fried in same oil as meat. Mar 2014 reported kitchen sloppy about veg orders, so be specific!",
