  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Chain of pub/restaurants - be warned that it's a carvery and is primarily meatstuff, but it's an option to go with non-veg diners. This one offers 3 vegan mains which are a butternut squash crumble, a lentil cottage pie, and a carrot chickpea wellington. The vegetables (apart from cauliflower and roast parsnips) and vegetarian gravy, which you help yourself to, are suitable for vegans. Check with manager if you have any questions. The chocolate & cherry torte dessert is vegan.",
