  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The Wednesday lunch is all-you-can eat with salad bar, pasta and pizza, and rice dishes. At dinner there is no menu or wine list. The owner will ask you about diet requests - this is the time to tell him that you are vegan or vegetarian and to tell him about any foods you don't like. He substitutes vegan cheese when it makes sense for the dish. Then he will bring out course after course of food tailored to your needs. The inside of the restaurant is roomy and intimate at the same time.",
