  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Began as a food truck in 2013 and has had a physical location in the Midtown Global Market since 2014. Fast casual Indian style burritos and rice bowls. 2 of the 5 main choices are vegan suitable: channa (chickpeas in a mild tomato curry) and aloo gobi (cauliflower, squash, potato in a spiced tomato curry). The vegetable samosas do share the fryer with the chicken samosas. The Indi frites (seasoned fries) are vegan but the dipping sauce is not - can be swapped with a side of vegan hot sauce.",
