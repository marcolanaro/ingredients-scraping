  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Local surf and skate culture themed coffeehouse. Offers a simple food menu that includes tempeh, veggie sausage, and vegan mayonaise in wrap and sandwich. Reported Apr 2013 the labeled \"vegan burrito\" comes in a honey wheat tortilla and thus not truly vegan--you could request to have the filling in a bowl instead. Prices cheap to moderate. Small and casual with wall mural art and Wi-Fi, located a block from the ocean.",
