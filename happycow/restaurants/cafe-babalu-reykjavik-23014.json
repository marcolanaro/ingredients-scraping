  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A charming, comfortable walk-up cafe in the city center with a rooftop deck. Maybe 100% veg or at least very vegetarian friendly. Offers crepes and lasagna on the menu, as well as cakes and cookies. Cafe drinks including coffee, tea, beer & wine. Has a vegan carrot cake for around 700 kr and chamomile soy latte. The owner seems to be a transplant from New York City who uses his own recipes for everything made there, including New York Cheesecake & chocolate cake (with dairy and egg). Has Wi-Fi.",
