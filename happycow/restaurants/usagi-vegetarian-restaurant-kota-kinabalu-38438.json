  "description": "Offers an upmarket all-you-can-eat quality buffet style service (not economy rice), along with a vegetarian sushi train for only RM 9.90. Has Japanese influence but is more broadly Asian with different dishes such as nasi lemak, curry, tofu dishes, and vegetables. Buffet includes soup and fruit. Plenty of vegan food but need to check what is available each day. 10-minute walk from the KK central tourist zone, in the Karamunsing Complex. Owner is a vegetarianism advocate.",
