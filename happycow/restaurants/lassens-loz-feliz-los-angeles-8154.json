  "description": "Natural food market with locations in California. This one took over the space of the former independently-owned Nature Mart. The store is a moderate size but is packed with a wide range of natural food and grocery; isles are a bit tight to accommodate the large selections. Has fresh fruits and vegetables including organic, vitamins and supplements, frozen and chilled food, and much more. There is a juice bar and deli in the very back. Parking on site.",
