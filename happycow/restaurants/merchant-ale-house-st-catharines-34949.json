Has a few vegan choices on the menu, including a vegan shawarma and the white bean dip with pita; plus soups, nachos, and dips can be made vegan upon request. Feb 2013: the portobello burger was replaced by a housemade veggie burger, which could be made vegan by omitting curry mayonaise. Has daiya cheese.",
