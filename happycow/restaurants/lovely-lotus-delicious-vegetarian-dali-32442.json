  "description": "A gourmet vegetarian restaurant with zen ambiance and attractive setting. Extensive menu with English provided. Individual dishes vary from 25-55 kuai (US$4-9); by Dali standards this is more expensive. Large servings. Fresh juices are available. Location is on the same side of the street (east side) as the YiRanTang buffet, a large sign directs you to the restaurant. Also possible to access from BoAiLu:博爱路. You take BoAiLu in the direction to the North gate. Pass Hong Long Jing (the street with the river and bars) and keep going down on BoAiLu. You will see the first alley on the right where the other Buddhist vegan restaurant is (Yi Ran Tang). Keep going on BoAiLu until you find another alley also on your right. (if you arrived at the big street RenMinLu, you went too far. It's a little before RenMinLu). When you get inside the alley, is on the right about 50m from BoAiLu. Chinese name 爱莲说素膳. Address in Chinese: 复兴路西侧九隆居B2-1号2号（古榕会馆对面）.",
