  "description": "Vegetarian cafe in a casual and colorful setting. All vegan except for cheese. Food is prepared daily and displayed in glass case at the counter. Organic beer and wine served. You could also order wines at the wine bar inside. Non-smoking. Directions: turn up the Neubaugasse from the Mariahilferstrasse, walk 4 minutes on the left side (you pass two roads off to the left in the proceeds) until you reach the Reformhaus Buchmaller store. Between this shop and the dry cleaners opposite is a covered pedestrian footpath that takes you up some low steps, past an apartment block complex & through to Ahornergasse, almost to the Landia front door.",
