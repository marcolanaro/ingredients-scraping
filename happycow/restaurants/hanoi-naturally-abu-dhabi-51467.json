  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Looks more like an cafeteria than a fancy restaurant and has old Abu Dhabi feel. This Vietnamese restaurant uses vegetable oil for cooking and no milk or butter at all. Vegetarians/vegans could get vegetarian spring rolls, summer rolls (ask for tofu), fried tofu, coconut root vegetable in claypot, stir fried water spinach with garlic, and several other dishes.",
