  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Breakfast has a different menu but you can also order from the dinner menu, which has a separate vegetarian section comprising nearly 20 choices which can be accommodated for vegans. Tofu is used instead of cheese due to the lack of cheese in Laos. Be aware that many Indian restaurants in Laos rely excessively on butter (ghee) so make it clear if you are vegan.
