Weekly deliveries are based on a canasta of seasonal and fresh, organic fruits, vegetables, root crops, and eggs. Every canasta comes with a short print article and recipe about one of the delivered products. Upon requests and additional payment, canastas may also come with a variety of organic vegan and vegetarian products.",
