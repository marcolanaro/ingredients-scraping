  "description": "A cooperative veggie food cafe in Christiania run by mostly youths. It's a 15 minute walk from Copenhagen centre or take bus 9A. Offers a daily selection of 5-6 prepared salads, 2 hot dishes, a soup of the day, and drinks. Kitchen staff changes, as do the flavors of the food depending on the cook on duty. Sit inside in the basic yet cozy space, or outside on wooden tables in the rustic garden among sparrows. Direction: walk 3 minute into Christiania, and you will come upon the restaurant (or ask someone). Confirmed open Mar 2016.",
