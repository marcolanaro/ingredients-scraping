  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. For Hildesheim, Die Insel is considered very vegetarian friendly. In general, this is a small sleepy city in central Germany that keeps to its meat based traditions, and so Die Insel's menu reflects this overall. There are 4 vegetarian options on the menu. Google maps shows the place right in the middle of the river; it's correct - you'll have to go see it to believe it.",
