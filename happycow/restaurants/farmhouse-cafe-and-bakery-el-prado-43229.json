  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Open space dining. Offers a few vegan choices, including quinoa cereal with soy or almond milk, potatoes, kale salad. The veggie nut burger could be made in a lettuce wrap instead of with buns, without the chevre cheese, and with the no-cheese pesto batch). Often times there is a vegetarian or vegan soup of the day - call ahead to check. Sunday is brunch. Maintains an onsite vegetable garden.",
