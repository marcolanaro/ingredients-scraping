  "description": "Charming restaurant in an Indian style. Also serves other dishes. Typically a choice of two meals - one Indian, one other (example: pasta) for approx R$18. You get a small starter and dessert, juice, and a substantial main course. Gets very busy with lines out of the door, somewhat calmer after 2pm. Most items contain dairy. Accepts debit cards but not credit cards.",
