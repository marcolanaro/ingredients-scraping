  "description": "Vegan restaurant housed in an old pub and former Latin restaurant and maintains a Latin American theme and menu. Opened Mar 2014. Uses nut-based cheeses and offers an extensive alcoholic beverage list. A bit crowded tables and a high step to the toilets. Gets busy so best to book ahead for night time dining.",
