  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Handmade ice cream. Ask for the water-based ice cream and not the milk ones. Vegan flavors include strawberry, cantaloupe, tamarind, lemon, mango, pineapple, banana. Fruit, sugar, and water made into ice cream on a big cold pan while you watch - not what you think of as \"fried.\"",
