  "description": "Vegan food truck at this location outside The Lost Well since summer 2015; previously at 3111 Manor Rd (location changes so check its webpage). Offers BBQ smoked on a smoker and served on a plate with sides like potato salad, coleslaw, mac and cheeze. Service stops when food runs out, so best to call ahead. Began service since Nov 2013.",
