  "description": "A vegetarian juice bar which is primarily vegan with the exception of bee pollen in a couple of smoothies. Uses quality organic produce. Has a custom built cold press juicer that gently applies 15,000 lbs of pressure, which avoids the heating effects of conventional juicers and retains the highest amount of natural enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. Located in the Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino. As of Oct 2014, one other location in Pasadena.",
