  "description": "Popular local eatery serving only one dish: koshary/kushari, a traditional Egyptian dish that's somewhere between chilli and pasta. It's generally made with chickpeas, lentils, fried onions, rice, and small noodle, and is almost always vegan (though some places have taken to adding meat, so be careful when ordering elsewhere). El Tahrir has a simple upstairs dining room and basic service. Just tell the server small, medium, or large. It's conveniently located just east of Midan Tahrir (the famous Tahrir Square). The closest metro station is Sadat.",
