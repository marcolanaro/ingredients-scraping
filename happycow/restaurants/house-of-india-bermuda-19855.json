  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Provides some lacto-ovo vegetarian, dairy-free, and gluten-free options. No vegan options are listed on the menu, so inquiring about vegan options is necessary for vegan customers. No Wi-fi. Directions: Taxi is recommended as it is located in a relatively remote area, not nearby the downtown core of Hamilton. Confirmed open March 2012.",
