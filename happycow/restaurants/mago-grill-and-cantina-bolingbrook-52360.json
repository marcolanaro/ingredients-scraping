  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Has a vegetarian section on the menu, of which two are vegan (tamales de frijoles and enchiladas de hongos); the others just ask for no cheese or sour cream. Complimentary bottomless tortilla chips with 3 made-in-house salsas. Guacamole made table-side. Clean, colorful; a modern take on the Mexican theme. Family-friendly. As of Oct 2014, has two other locations.",
