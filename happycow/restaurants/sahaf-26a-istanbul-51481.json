  "description": "A collective cafe run by an anarchist-leaning political group in Istanbul called DAF. Previously served meat, but took all meat off the menu and made the place entirely vegetarian. Prepares snacks such as toasted cheese sandwiches and toasted vegan (green pepper, tomato, olive spread) sandwiches. Scrambled eggs served in daytime. Sometimes there are hot stews and always serves pasta. Zapatista coffee is available as well. Employees fluently speak English, and are familiar with the difference between vegan and vegetarian ingredients.",
