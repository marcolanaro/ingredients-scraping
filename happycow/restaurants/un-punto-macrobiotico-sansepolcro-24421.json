  "description": "Part of a network of macrobiotic restaurants in Italy run by a macrobiotic cultural association. Set menu on a blackboard. Green tea to drink as part of the meal. Other drinks like barley cup are available, but no coffee. Wine is served on request. Before you eat you pay a one-off fee of â‚¬5 to join the cultural association for which you will need ID. You get a membership card which entitles you to eat at any of the associations' restaurants worldwide. The set meal is extremely cheap.",
