  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Small cafe very close to the entrance of Zion National Park. The paper menu has a different label/symbol for vegan and vegetarian (the online menu does not clearly label vegan). Vegan items include a tofu scramble with Daiya cheese, steel cut oats or sprouted buckwheat groats with seeds/nuts/fresh fruits and the option of soy, almond, or coconut milk. For lunch an Asian tofu wrap, hummus wrap, ultimate veggie wrap (loaded with filling veggies), and some pizzas and sandwiches that can be made vegan. Also has vegan cookies (not made-in-house).",
