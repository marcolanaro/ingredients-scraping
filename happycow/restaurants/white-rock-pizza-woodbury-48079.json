  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The owner Maggie makes sourdough crust with yeast grown here that originated in Italy: flour, water, yeast, sal, and olive oil. She offers gluten-free crust as well and Daiya cheese for vegans. Desserts are made in-house, and occasionally there is something vegan. Casual setting with a lakeside view in the summer and a wood fireplace in the winter.",
