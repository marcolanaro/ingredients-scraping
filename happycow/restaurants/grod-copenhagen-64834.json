  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Small breakfast/lunch restaurant that serves different kinds of porridge, both sweet and savory. All breakfasts are vegetarian, as most porridges are cooked in a combination of water, juice and (soy/rice/almond) milk. Some options are already vegan, but all can be made vegan on request. The savory porridges that can be made vegan are listed as such on the menu. Also sells granolas and other condiments. ",
