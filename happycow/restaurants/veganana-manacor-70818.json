  "description": "A 100% vegan shop that offers a small but well selected range of vegan food products. In the small but very nice shop in downtown Manacor you get no fruits or vegetables, but many vegan products that you do not get in the supermarket. Especially frozen products such as vegan cutlets, ice, cold cuts, cheese, tofu, tempeh, and some others. Of course, spreads, vegan milk in many varieties, sweets, spices and many other products are also stocked. A great address for those who want to buy vegan products, without having to drive to Palma.",
