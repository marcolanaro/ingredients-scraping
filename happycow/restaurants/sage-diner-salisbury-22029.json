  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Offers soups, wraps, sandwiches, and salads. Despite not having a very veggie friendly menu, it's one place that it is confirmed that has vegetarian and vegan options in the Salisbury MD area. The fresh fruit cocktail is vegan, and the vegetarian wrap can be veganized without the cheese and coleslaw side dish. They also have a garden salad, vegetable platter, and veggie burger, though the veggie burger may not be vegan. The plain veggie side dishes are normally cooked in butter, so if you are a vegan, you will want to specially request that your veggies not be cooked in it.",
