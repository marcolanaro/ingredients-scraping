  "description": "One of the string of Thai food vegetarian restaurants in Los Angeles. The extensive menu includes breakfast all day, sandwiches and veggie burgers, salads, Thai curry and stir frys, noodles, and more. Red/brown rice served. Casual, modern decor with flat screen TVs. Prices range from cheap to moderate. NOTE: Not everything is vegan, so ask. HappyCow has received numerous reports that staff is not always knowledgeable/honest on what is vegan and that they may still be using animal based products in some dishes.",
