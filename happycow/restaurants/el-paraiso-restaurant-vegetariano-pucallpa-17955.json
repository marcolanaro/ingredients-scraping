  "description": "Pucallpa is a sweltering jungle city in Peru's Amazon Basin, and the only jungle city connected to the rest of Peru by road. One reason to visit is to board a river ferry traveling from Pucallpa to Iquitos and beyond. El Paraiso is a cruelty-free oasis in this fishing town. It offers set meals (soup, entree, drink) for around 9 soles (US$3), and an a la carte menu. Meals are of ample size. Egg is used in some dishes; otherwise it's all vegan. There TV is loud. This small restaurant is on the Plaza de Armas, at the back of a walkway. A sign out front points the way.",
