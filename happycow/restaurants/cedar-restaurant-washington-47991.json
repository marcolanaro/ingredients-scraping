  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Standard upscale restaurant except that the chef here is vegan friendly; he once participated in VegWeek with a vegan menu. The vegan menu continues - ask for it, and you'll have 2-3 choices per course for a prix fixe vegan 3-course menu with a drink, dessert, appetizer, and entree, or, order a la carte. Otherwise, beware that the regular menu is meat and dairy based.",
