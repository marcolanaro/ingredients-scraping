  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Traditional, meat-based Italian restaurant but servers will assist in modifying a pasta dish to suit. For example, you could ask for penne with extra vegetables in a tomato sauce instead of cream sauce. Otherwise very limited choices for pure veg food in Key West, so when in old town and with omnivores, this could be a possibility.",
