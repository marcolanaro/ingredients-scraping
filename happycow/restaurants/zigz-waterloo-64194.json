  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A bakery/cafe with a daily production of cakes, cookies, pancakes and savory dishes. Owned and managed by a long time vegetarian. Roasted vegetables and Mediterranean dishes, soups and other veggie dishes available daily for lunch, some of which are vegan. Serves very little meat, and business permitting, it will be phased out as soon as possible. Please contact HappyCow when they convert to 100% vegetarian/vegan by updating the listing - thank you. ",
