  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. In late 2012 Evergreen House (vegan restaurant) moved inside Golden Phoenix restaurant (non-veg). There are two separate kitchens here, Evergreen's is all vegan. However, as reported Jan 2013, there's no longer a separate room dedicated to the Evergreen House vegan food and menu. Everyone is seated in the main area, and given a menu that includes non-vegan food. Be sure to ask specifically for the Evergreen menu.",
