  "description": "Privately owned hostel at the bottom of Cwm Pennant valley. Serves breakfast to guests. Non-veg but let them know if you're vegan, the owners will provide soya milk, cereals, toast, vegan spreads and jam, plus cooked breakfast with vegan sausages, beans, hash brown, and usually fresh tomatoes and mushrooms as well as a glass of fruit juice, and tea or coffee. Can also book ahead for main meals. A step down into the main dining room is required as the building is old, designed originally for horses rather than people (it was the coach house and barn for the long gone Brynkir Hall).",
