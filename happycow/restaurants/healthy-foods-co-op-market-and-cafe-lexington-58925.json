Located in the heart of historic downtown; an easy walk from Washington and Lee University and Virginia Military Institute. The Counter Culture Cafe, in the back of the store, serves a 100% organic/local made-in-house from scratch vegetarian and vegan lunch during the week and offers plenty of \"grab n' go\" items after hours. The store is a social center, a place where locals, visitors, and the academic communities meet and mingle.",
