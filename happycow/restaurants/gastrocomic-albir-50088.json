The atmosphere is casual, comic and cartoon themed. Browse comic books and novels or checkout the super hero figurines placed around the rooms. Children friendly. The vegetarian section of the menu offers some dishes that can be veganized like burgers, wraps, and tortilla. Accommodate special requests.",
