  "description": "Last order taken at 4:30pm. Named Ryoanji Yudofu (Ryoanji Seven Herb Tofu, in English), because its famous dish is yudofu (boiled tofu with vegetables and seven herbs). The restaurant is inside the Ryoanji Temple area, in the Seigenin building (a minor temple attached to the main temple and situated by the Kyoyoike pond- a 1000-year-old Koi pond). English menu available. Nice food and setting. Address in Japanese: 京都府京都市右京区龍安寺御陵ノ下町13.",
