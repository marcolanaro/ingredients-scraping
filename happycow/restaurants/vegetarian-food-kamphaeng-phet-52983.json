  "description": "Opened in 2014, a vegetarian restaurant located close to the provincial police HQ. Even though there is a major UNESCO World Heritage Site in the city, there are few tourists here. Serves a variety of Thai vegan food. Possibly no menus, so just verbally communicate with the staff (speaks broken English). A full meal can be had for $3 (as of 11/14), so cheap by western standards. No Wi-Fi. Not really a place to hang out, just arrive, eat, and leave.",
