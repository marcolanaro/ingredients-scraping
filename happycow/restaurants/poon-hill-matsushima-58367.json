  "description": "A vegetarian curry and naan restaurant in Miyagi district a short walk from Takagimachi station on the Senseki line, or a slightly longer walk from Matsushima station on the Tohoku Honsen line. Serves lunch from a rotating menu on weekends and takes reservations outside of opening hours - will open for meals until 5 pm with a reservation the day before. Food service is on a first-come, first-served basis, so better to call and confirm food is not sold out. Also sells frozen items to take home.",
