  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Thai food place with vegan menu section that offers faux meats in dishes. A bit hard to find - it's midway between Mae Haad Bay and Chalok Bay, from Mae Haad you'll find a dust road turning right, the road sign says Pinnacle, and the restaurant is right before Castle Night Club, follow that road for 300m and you'll see it on the right side of a steep road.\r\n",
