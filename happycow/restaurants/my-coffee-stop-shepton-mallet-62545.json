  "description": "Coffee, health food, and community cinema. A unique find in Shepton Mallet since 2013, with a \"home from home\" atmosphere and free Wi-Fi. Everything is vegetarians. Offers vegan ice cream cake, vegan brownies, and a daily special vegan dish. You could also get a hot chocolate made with almond milk and vegan marshmallows. A small retail section sells books, and the ingredients you need to recreate some of the recipes at home.",
