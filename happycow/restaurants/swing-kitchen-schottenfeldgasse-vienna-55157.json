  "description": "Its first of two vegan fast food cafes, this one opened Feb 2015. Serves primarily burgers plus wraps, salads, sides, sweets and drinks, partly organic. Plays swing music in the background. Does not use plastic--everything which looks like plastic is CO2-neutral and bio-degradable--and sources electricity from renewable energy.",
