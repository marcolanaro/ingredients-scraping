Well-known in town for their tofu scrambles, burritos, falafel, and fresh salads. Made-in-house peanut, spicy, and yogurt sauces. Several vegan choices, plus ask for items to be made without mayonnaise and cream. Comfortable setting with eclectic live music. Also offers a small selection of jams and other  healthy items.
