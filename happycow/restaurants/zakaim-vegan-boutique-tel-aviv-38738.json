  "description": "Opened by the two sisters and one brother of the Zakaim family in spring 2013. Offers food made from local and seasonal products. The restaurant, built and designed almost entirely by the brothers themselves, is an ecological space where all of the materials, dishes and furniture are secondhand. Try the hand-torn potato chips with house-made ketchup.",
