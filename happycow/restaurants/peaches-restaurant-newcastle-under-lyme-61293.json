  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Chinese restaurant with semi-formal decor. Offers an all-you-can-eat option where the food is brought to your table. Lots of tofu dishes (satay sauce vegan), could order seaweed without the topping, the sesame toast is vegan, plus a few other starters. Busy on weekends so better book ahead.",
