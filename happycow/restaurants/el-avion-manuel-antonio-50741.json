  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. This restaurant has a cute theme where it's taken the body of a 1954 Fairchild cargo plane which was originally purchased by the US government in the 80s for the Nicaraguan contras, but it never made out of its hangar in San Jos√© because of the ensuing Iran-Contra scandal. In 2000 the owners purchased it for cheap and proceeded to cart it piece by piece to Manuel Antonio. It now sits on the side of the main road, where it looks as if it had crash-landed into the side of the hill. It's a spot for drinks, dinner, and a Pacific sunset. The oriental salad and oriental fried rice are both vegan suitable.",
