  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A small falafel restaurant that doesn't sell the usual kebab-products. The main dish is the falafel (vegetarian), which costs around 7CHF to start. Offers a \"deluxe\" version with additional veggie toppings. Vegan sauce on request. The place is run by an artist who exhibits some of his social-critical works in the restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and there's always jazz music playing. Only 2 tables inside, a bar against which you can lean, and a table outside. Busy at noon.",
