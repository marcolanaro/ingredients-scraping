  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Cozy little Ethiopian restaurant in the Latin Quarter. Offers a separate vegetarian menu, although it seems to list fish under that menu. Puts butter in most of their vegetarian dishes. Has a traditional vegetarian/vegan platter for four, with extra injera bread. Also has good inexpensive Ethiopian beer. Seems to get quite crowded around 9pm.",
