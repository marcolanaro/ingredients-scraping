  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A gastropub, with a cozy relaxed atmosphere, serves tapas and a wide selection of beers, some of which are vegan. Provides vegan dishes, and not just a salad; has both full meals and smaller items. Also serves food for special requirements/allergies. Has the longest bar in Scandinavia (2nd longest in Europe). The house is an old iron factory so it has a robust feeling to it. Also is an event venue. Free Wi-Fi.",
