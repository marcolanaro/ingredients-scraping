  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Electic coffee house with a few locations in Orange county, this one opened since 2012. Mostly veg friendly meals but does offer eggs on the breakfast menu and cheese on some items. On the lunch menu, a few items are made with chicken or turkey, but some proteins offered are vegan (such as soy chicken, veggie bacon and sausage, veggie burger and soyrizo). Full coffee bar and desserts selection. Stopped vegan brunch.",
