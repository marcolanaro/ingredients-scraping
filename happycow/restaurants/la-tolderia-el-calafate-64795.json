  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Standard restaurant by day, then a club & bar by night from 1am on. Has vegetarian dishes but not much for vegans except salads. Reported staff will try to accommodate when you ask to omit cheese/dairy, but you have to be very specific. Not much else for veg food in this region.",
