Contemporary Southwestern Native American cuisine that's predominately meat but vegetarians could have the portobello burger, navajo taco, fries (ask if same fryer). Has cactus pear lemonade. Vegans should specify as honey and dairy is used. The menu draws from the Navajo, Hidatsa, Hopi, and Mandan tribes. Hip vibe with a silversmith shop off the side of the restaurant.",
