  "description": "麗姐素菜館 is a veggie food stall in Samphantawongse (China Town), next to Check Inn Chinatown hotel. Look for the red & yellow \"jay\" flags (vegetarian). Everything on the menu (with pictures) is supposed to be vegan, made with tofu, noodle, and rice. Not sure if the mock meats are vegan or not.",
