  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A fries-shop/snackbar that uses only plant based oils (sunflower, rapeseed or palm). Accommodates vegans with their requests. As of May 2016 you can order kroket (croquette), bitterballen and bami schijf (bio/organic), all from the Dutch company The Vegetarian Butcher. Ask for the vegan version (instead of the regular ones). Serves large portions of fries. View on the Waterpoort (miniature version of Arc de Triomphe).",
