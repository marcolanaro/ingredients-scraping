  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The in-house menu clearly labels vegan dishes and ones that can be made vegan. Try the crispy tiger prawns made of soy protein. A major plus is that the vegan versions of some dishes include tofu as a substitute (rather than just leaving out the meat). Chef is happy to customize dishes for you; just ask. Located right at the entrance to Cheddar Gorge.",
