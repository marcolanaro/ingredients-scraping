  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Funky little family-run Vietnamese place. The main dining area is in the back and is dim and quiet, with a TV in one corner. Service is slow, but you can go to the front and pay whenever you like. While the menu is predominately meat based, the vegetarian/vegan section on the menu features around 10 dishes including salad rolls (rice paper with tofu, mint), vege fish, lemongrass-chili tofu. Sells a wide selection of ethnic drinks, from durian shakes to salty lemonade.",
