  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Large restaurant with a bar, atmosphere is like a French brasserie. Vegetarians could get the salads, a vegetarian schnitzel, or two dishes called \"my veggie day\" which comprise pasta with champignon-cream-sauce and peas. Three of the pasta dishes are vegan suitable: macaroni forever, macaroni high noon, and spaghetti bonanza. The pasta itself is without egg. Basic and affordable meals.",
