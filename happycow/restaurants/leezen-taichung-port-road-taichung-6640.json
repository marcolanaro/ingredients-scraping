Most items are vegan, some with dairy. This location is quite large and well stocked with a range of dried food products and snacks as well as a refrigerated case and organic underwear. Upstairs is a casual vegetarian restaurant where you can lounge and get a meal. Located across the street and down a little from the Evergreen Laurel Hotel.",
