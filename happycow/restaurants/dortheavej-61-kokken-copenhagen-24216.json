  "description": "Not a restaurant but a once-a-week people's kitchen upstairs at the youth house (Ungdomshuset). Meals vary, and sells items such as TVP and sometimes vegan meats - you have to ask for it. Ungdomshuset also hosts various concerts and events (see website). At some of the larger events vegan food will be sold. A small book-cafe, also open on Thursday, offers coffee by donation. Located near 5A bus stop hulgards plads/tomgardsvej, 15-minute walk from Norrebro station.",
