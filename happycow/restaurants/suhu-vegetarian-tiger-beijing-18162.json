  "description": "素虎素餐, at 海淀区双清路88号华源写字楼东南侧2楼203号, translates to \"Vegetarian Tiger.\" Gets very crowded during lunch and dinner. Try the blueberry yam. Serves Chinese vegan egg tarts and baked vegan dim sum. Mock meat and fake fish goes well with fried mushroom tempura. It's situated close to the east gate of Beijing University- take a bus (355) and go about 3 bus-stops to arrive at this place. Walk around the big building complex as the restaurant is in the back, on the second floor.",
