  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. In a very small town with little vegetarian choices, this little simple restaurant has a menu that includes 2 pages devoted to vegetarian options. Staff understands what \"vegetarian\" and \"vegan\" mean. No fish-sauce or shrimp paste used in the vegetarian curry, no chicken broth in the specific vegetarian soups, and will leave the eggs out of the pad Thai and other dishes to make them vegan upon request. When driving Interstate-5, one often needs eat lunch just about the time you hit the small burg of Centralia.",
