  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Cafe-style venue with retro-esque furniture. All food is made-in-house (including the bread). Most meals can be made gluten free on request if it is not already. A vegan breakfast is available and on the regular menu and in addition many of the sweets are vegan. Staff are knowledgeable about which dishes are already (or can easily be made) vegan. Non-dairy spreads like nuttelex are also readily available. Can be slow during peak periods because everything is made fresh.",
