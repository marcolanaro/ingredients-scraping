  "description": "A vegetarian restaurant located near a popular square in Los Palos Grandes. The food is made-in-house in the morning and then gets placed in a large refrigerator, along with cold press juices, desserts, breakfasts and other vegetarian goods, some of which are vegan. Most desserts and some dishes are sweetened with honey, so may want to ask. Dishes include veggie fried rice, quinoa sushi rolls, rice paper wraps, quinoa salads and more.",
