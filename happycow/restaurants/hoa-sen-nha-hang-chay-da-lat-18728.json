  "description": "An extensive menu that includes traditional Vietnamese breakfast soups, hot pots, stir frys, clay pots, baked tofu dishes, salads, and sandwiches. The majority of the dishes contain soy or wheat-based mock-meats. Nice atmosphere with high ceilings, linen table clothes, lots of plants. Try the lemongrass tofu and the pho bo/ga, and bun rieu (vermicelli crab with a tomato base soup). Meals are served with hot tea. The menu is translated into English but very limited spoken English. The prices range between 15,000-40,000 dong.",
