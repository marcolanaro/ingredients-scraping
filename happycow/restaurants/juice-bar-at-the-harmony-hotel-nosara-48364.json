  "description": "Cafe/juice bar is separate from the main dining room of the hotel and is situated under the shade of a traditional thatched ranchito. Offers a mostly vegan menu with a few vegetarian items that can very easily be made vegan. Juice bar was created by the hotel's organic and sustainable field-to-table farming project. Menu items include fresh harvested salads, sandwiches served on made-in-house multi grain bread, and smoothies and juices squeezed from the farmâ€™s fruits and veggies.",
