  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Previously called Cool Dog Cafe and was listed on HappyCow. Has re-opened in a new location. Vegan choices are soy hot dogs, many vegan toppings, fresh cut fries cooked in a dedicated fryer using canola oil. The staff is well-informed about the vegan items. Please note that there is no mention of soy hot dogs nor does it mention vegan items on the online menu; perhaps the paper menu does.",
