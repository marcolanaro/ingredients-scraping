Has a few vegetarian options including gniocchi, raviolette oswaldo (veggie ravioli in sweet potato sauce, and veggie combo (falafel, hummus, tabouleh). Set up in a funky old house, the downstairs dining room revels in kitschy trinkets from the last century - board games, dolls, and train sets mingle with funky lamps, books, and presidential memorabilia. Reservations suggested. May have only a few vegan options.",
