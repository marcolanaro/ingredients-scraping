  "description": "A cozy 100% vegan/vegetarian cafe and community art space. Most food options are vegan and locally sourced. Opened Nov 2015 in a lively neighborhood (Besiktas). Language, dance, photography, meditation, acting and music lessons are planned to take place here with moderate pricing. Construction materials used in the cafe are primarily recycled or rescued from street. So much wood and almost no plastic. NA means no in Kurdish and Persian and stands for no to consumerism, expensive life, animal exploitation, violence against women and more.",
