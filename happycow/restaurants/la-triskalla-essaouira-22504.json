  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Cavernous atmospheric Morrocan cafe attracting both locals and travelers and is located in an alleyway near the ramparts of Essaouira. The menu is largely un-Moroccan and served by an English-speaking staff. Miso or bissara (fava bean) soups, fresh and crunchy salads, omelets, and specialties such as vegetarian lasagna are joined by delights such as buckwheat pancakes. For something sweet, try the daily fruit tart, perhaps accompanied by a fresh juice or one of a large selection of herbal and chai teas. It's Wi-fi connected, and on selected nights they set up the DVD player and screens various environmental, wildlife, and cultural movies.",
