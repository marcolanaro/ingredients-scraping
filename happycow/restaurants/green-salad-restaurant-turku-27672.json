  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. 2014 relocated from Eerikinkatu 7 to Hansa shopping centre, now in the food court amongst other food shops. Being not so easy to find a veg restaurant in Turku during summer as some are open only during university time, this one has a few choices. Offers large vegan salads with croutons, nuts, and fruit. Ask for tofu instead of cheese.",
