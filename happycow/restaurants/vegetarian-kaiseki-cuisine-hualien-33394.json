  "description": "Chinese name 養心樓素食懷石料理, address 花蓮縣花蓮市國富里莊敬路88號, 970. This place adapts the Japanese multi-course tradition to Taiwanese palettes and gives it a veg twist. Occasionally some items use dairy products but they will ask you when you book if you avoid dairy/egg and other allergens. Courses are served in different bowls and plates like works of art. Food is light, healthy, and filling. Cost is around NT$600 per person. No walk-ins.",
