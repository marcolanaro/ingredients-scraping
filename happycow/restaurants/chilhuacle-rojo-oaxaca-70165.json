  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Little restaurant in a courtyard serving Oaxacan style breakfast til 1pm. The theme is farm to table with all the produce sourced from the chef's family farm. You get fresh squeezed juice, fruit cup, coffee, entree of your choice, then hot chocolate (with ginger and orange rind). His mother makes the chocolate that he uses. Makes a coloradito mole which is vegan. Chef is so willing to accommodate and cook what you want - just let him know.  Will open for dinner by reservation.",
