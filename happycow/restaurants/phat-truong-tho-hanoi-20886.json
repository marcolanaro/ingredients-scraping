  "description": "Managed by the local Buddhists. Large choice of mock meat dishes including vege shrimp. The staff speaks English. The interior is ornate and decorated in the Tibetan Buddhist style, complete with two large gold statues of Buddha. The entire restaurant is run for charity, so all profits are put back into the community. A taxi ride from central Hanoi to this location costs around 72,000 VND (4 US).
