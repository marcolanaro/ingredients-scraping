  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. This place is very small and has odd hours particularly during the off-season, so call ahead. Always has something vegan, and sometimes other vegetarian ones, but you have to ask as vegan/veg items are not be on the menu. Often uses soy and seitan based products to make meat-like dishes.
