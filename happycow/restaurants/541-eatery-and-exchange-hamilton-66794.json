  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Offers fresh, homemade meals and baked goods, using locally sourced ingredients. A vegan soup is always on offer as well as chili, salad, and usually a vegan dinner entree which changes from night to night. Chefs can modify dishes to make them vegan. Other vegan choices are lattes, muffins, brownies, granola bars, and hot chocolate (just ask for soy milk). Everything in the cafe is nut-free and there are gluten-free options as well. This is a social enterprise with a pay-it-forward system you are encouraged to donate to or benefit from, depending on your financial status. The community is friendly, open, and accepting.",
