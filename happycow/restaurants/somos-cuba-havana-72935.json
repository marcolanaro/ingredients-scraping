  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. On the second floor of a very old and crumbling building in Havana Vieja. The staff speaks English. Vegans could ask for a vegan plate. The decoration is artistic with lots of pictures of the Che, flags, vinyls, etc. You don't feel like you are in a touristic restaurant there and the place itself is worth a look.",
