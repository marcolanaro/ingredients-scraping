  "description": "Vegetarian cafe located in Oslo's oldest squat, Blitz. Renovated Aug 2010. A selection of sandwiches and baguettes, plus one main dish each day. The main dish is not always vegan. The sandwiches start at around 20 NOK, and there's always a vegan alternative. Famous for their waffles (not vegan). During summer and Christmas, Blitz might be closed or only open for a few hours each day. See website for live music & events.",
