  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Italian food bistro. The owner's wife is vegetarian, and most soup and sauce bases are made without meat or fish thus allowing for easy substitutions. Meat that is served is mostly grass fed local product. Owner will offers suggestions and make something for you when you let him know that you are vegetarian. Very few choices otherwise for vegetarian food in the area.",
