  "description": "This supermarket is a conventional food store. But, as with many American conventional markets these days, they want to broaden their reach to natural food consumers. So their shelves are stocked with some natural food from the more popular natural food companies and the large food corporations. Cascadian Farms, Woodstock Farms, Thai Kitchen, Annie's, Amy's, Hansen Soda, etc... The natural grocery stuff are shelved  in different isles throughout the store, so you have to go up and down the items and keep your eye out for them. Prices are moderate to high, depending on the item. Also, the area is more upscale so food is more expensive then other parts of Maui.",
