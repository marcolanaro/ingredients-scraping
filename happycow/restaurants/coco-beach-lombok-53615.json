  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Beachside restaurant, slightly outside of Senggigi. Has plenty of vegan choices all made with veggies and herbs grown in on-site organic garden. Try the tapioca leaf in coconut milk, the tofu cakes, the baby potatoes tossed in garlic and rosemary, the fried corn or vegetable cakes. Will also create dishes not on the menu as long as the ingredients are in the garden. Herbal drinks and medicinal teas are available. Dine in your own garden pavilion hut. Very peaceful, laid back place and inexpensive. As of December 2014, average plate is $1.50. A bit hard to find but most taxis know it. Make a small left turn a few hundred meters north of Svarga Resort.  ",
