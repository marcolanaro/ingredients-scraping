  "description": "Not a shop; if you are in Folkestone area you could place an order online & arrange to collect from the factory. Otherwise they delivers throughout Europe. Pioneer vegan Arthur Ling & now his son Adrian have been promoting veganism since the 1940s. Arthur started soya milk production in 1965, then added chocolate & carob bars in the early 80s, then chocolate spreads & vegan mayonnaise.",
