  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Has some vegan choices and are written only on the specials' board as this is something that the new owner just added (April 2016). Vegan main meals include spicy smoked mixed bean chili & rice and lentil & potato mild curry. The  Moroccan tagine with roasted squash & chickpeas served with couscous can be made vegan by substituting the honey. Also has made-in-house soups like carrot & coriander and in the summer offers salads; vegans please inquire. The bruschetta is a customer favorite. Uses locally grown ingredients wherever possible, including nearly all vegetables and herbs. Has indoor and outdoor seating and easy parking. Speaks Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, and some French.",
