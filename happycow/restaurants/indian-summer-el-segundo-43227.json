  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Typical non-veg Indian food menu, includes vegetable dishes made with tofu and ones without dairy or egg. Staff is aware of the term vegan, and kitchen could accommodate vegan requests. The lunch buffet, however, has limited one or two vegan suitable choices, so it's better to order a la carte.
