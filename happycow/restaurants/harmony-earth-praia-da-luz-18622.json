  "description": "A walk into Meri Hanlin's health shop is a truly an experience. The first thing that hits you is the wonderful smell - a combination of natural oils, perfumes, incense and essences. Next are the colorful displays of just about everything you could want in a health shop: vitamins, minerals, tonics, tinctures, lip balms, cosmetics, and enticing foods and drinks, as well as all sorts of cleaning products and pet foods. It's one of those places you need time to look around, a place for anyone seeking an alternative way of dealing with life. Her section given over to gluten-free products is second to none, and she's got everything for anyone following a vegan, vegetarian, raw food or other healthy diets. Carries everything coconut, from water and oil to flour and milks. Meri is always ready to give her expert advice - just ask.",
