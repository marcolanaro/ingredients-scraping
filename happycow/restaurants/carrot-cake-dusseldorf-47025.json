  "description": "A 100% vegan cafe with smaller hearty dishes like wraps and sandwiches. In-house made cakes and cupcakes are available as well as cookies, fruit gum and chocolate. On Saturdays and Sundays you can also have breakfast including cheese and cold cuts. Drinks are bottled and non-alcoholic. Outside seating is very limited with a single two-seat bench, but on the inside there is plenty of room at 4 tables plus a row of bar tables by the window. Atmosphere is very calm and quiet and welcoming.",
