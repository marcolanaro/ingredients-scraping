  "description": "Small, casual cafe. Menu consists of many mockmeat dishes, everything dairy-free. Food is prepared in the morning and sits out all day. Some dishes may contain MSG. Made popular by Lonely Planet, though just a simple/standard Jay place. Can get busy. Note: Foreign customers may get charged differently than locals. Confirmed open April 2012.",
