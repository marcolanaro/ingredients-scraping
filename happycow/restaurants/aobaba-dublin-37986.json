  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Offers Vietnamese noodle soups and dishes as well as bubble teas. Noodle soups can be made with a vegetable broth and served with fried tofu and marinated fried gluten strips. The summer rolls can also be made veg. Restaurant is on a block dense with Asian restaurants, and has a no-nonsense but clean pastel interior. Most dishes are 6 Euros for a sizable portion, which is incredibly affordable for Dublin. This is a branch of a British restaurant but the menu in Dublin is very different.",
