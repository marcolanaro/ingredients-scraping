  "description": "A friendly little wholefood store near the cathedral. Stocks a range of produce including vegan products such as ready to eat tofu, soya yoghurt, and some organic vegan tartlets and biscuits. Directions: Maybe difficult to find. Look for the PAUL bakery on the corner, and Cavea is in that little street.",
