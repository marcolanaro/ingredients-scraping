  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A contemporary restaurant with a charming decor and a date night atmosphere. Most of the wait staff speak English and there is an English menu. An extensive drink menu and a 'veggies' section of the menu are available. Try the couscous with veggies and cashews and inform wait staff that you are vegan so no butter or chicken stock will be used. Other vegan choices are on offer; some of which are vegan or can be made vegan. A popular place, so best to make reservations or come early.",
