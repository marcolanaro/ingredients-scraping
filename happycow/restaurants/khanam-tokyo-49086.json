  "description": "Small vegan bakery located 5 minutes from Nishi-Ogikubo station on the JR Chuo line. Sells a variety of muffins, scones, cakes and cookies. The place is quite popular, so it sells out fast on the weekends. \r\nAddress in Japanese: 東京都杉並区松庵３−３８−２０. A second branch with eat-in space called Trim, located 10 minutes away.",
