  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Indian food with meat on the menu, but there are also many vegetables dishes as well as some sides. Uses fresh ingredients. In Cascais it is difficult to find good vegetarian food because restaurants, even those with veg food usually offer only one or two options (like an omelet or a salad), but Masala offers a variety of vegetable dishes. Vegans to specify.",
