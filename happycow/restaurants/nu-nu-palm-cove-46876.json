  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Tropical, Asian-inspired fine dining in a prime location overlooking Palm Cove beach. Highly atmospheric. Menu can be vegan friendly on request, but reservations guarantee a more receptive and varied vegan meal. Tapas can also be made vegan such as chunky chips with salt and vinegar, olives, cassava chips (normally made with meat stock, so ask for vegan when you order). Reservations are suggested. Let the staff know how many courses you require upon booking.",
