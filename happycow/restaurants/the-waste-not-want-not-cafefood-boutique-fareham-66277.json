  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A 100% vegan/vegetarian place with a pay-as-you-feel basis which could include money, your time or a skill such as playing piano. Concept is to save/intercept food before it gets binned/goes to landfills as it is still edible. Meals change daily. The food that is cooked is 100% vegan/vegetarian; however the food boutique may contain tinned/packaged food that may contain meat because food is intercepted daily and they have no control on what they receive. Once there is a place to pass this food onto it will be no meat on premises. Welcomes everyone to cafe nights, and even if you don't want to eat you can check out the food boutique where you can take food away also on a pay-as-you-feel basis.",
