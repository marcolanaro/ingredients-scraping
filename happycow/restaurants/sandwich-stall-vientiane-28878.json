  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Vietnamese style pickled veggies (daikon, carrot, cucumber, cilantro) on a french baguette. There are three stalls at the bus station. Little bit of English spoken. Tell the staff \"jay,\" which means vegetarian. Also when you order point to the mayonnaise and say no if you are vegan. One small sandwich (which is large) is 5000kip or about 60 cents. Closes when food runs out.",
