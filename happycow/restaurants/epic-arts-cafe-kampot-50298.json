  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Established 2006, the idea for this cafe grew from a desire to provide work opportunities for deaf and disabled people as well as a hang-out for deaf students. Today, the cafe stands as a model for an inclusive working environment within the local community, providing employment for ten people and raising funds for the work of Epic Arts. Offers a few vegetarian items and can accommodate vegans for cold dishes. Plenty of fresh fruit smoothies and juices.",
