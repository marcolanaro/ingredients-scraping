  "description": "Everything artistically presented with tempting dishes such as vegetable sausages and \"steak\" on an iron slab combines round juicy dried bean curd and fried potato chips. The most typical one is the water-boiled fish with red pepper (shui zhu yu). Contained in a special utensil which resembles a Buddhist alms bowl, the fish looks like the real thing. Behind Disco Agoyo, Changhongqiao, East Third Ring Road. Subway: Tuanjiehu. Directions: Maybe difficult to find. Walking from the Tuanjiehu subway station east on the Nongzhanguan Nanlu turn right immediately before McDonalds, and turn right passing the hotel Hanting Express (look for horse symbol).",
