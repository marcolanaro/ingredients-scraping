  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Baja Mexican style. Has a veggie taco and an avocado taco (ask to omit cheese). Try the tempeh taco (vegans need to ask for joey sauce). You could also sub tempeh on many of the other tacos. The cilantro rice, black beans, and all salads are vegan suitable - but do confirm.",
