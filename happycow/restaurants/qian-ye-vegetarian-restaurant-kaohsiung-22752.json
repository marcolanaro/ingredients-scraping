  "description": "Buffet selection includes small salad bar and a few varieties of sushi/seaweed, noodles, vegetables, stews, dumplings, and bean curd dishes. Choice of white or brown rice. Egg dishes seem easy to spot and steer clear of. Not priced by weight, as in some other Taiwanese buffets - cashier looks at your selection and calculates a price. There's also a choice of soups (including Chinese herbal, and mixed fungi) that are priced separately. Lots of simple, but pleasant, fan-cooled seating on 2nd floor. Look for a sign in English \"Vegetarian Rice Dumplings\". Address in Chinese: 高雄市鹽埕區大義街131號.",
