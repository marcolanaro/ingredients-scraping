  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Japanese restaurant. Has a few vegetarian and vegan options including tofu, noodle, and seaweed soup. The only vegan dishes on the menu are the vegetable sushi and edamame. Note: Reported that the noodle/tofu soup is not vegan as the stock contains fish sauce, and they were unable to create an alternative.  The vegetable noodle dish is not vegan as the batter on the vegetables contains eggs and the stock contains fish sauce. The staff found it hard to answer questions and were unhelpful in making dishes without fish sauce. They said variants were not possible as they would not taste good.\r\n",
