  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Salvadorean woman with a fruit stall who sells cold fruit juices, fruit, and tamales. While most of the tamales contain meat, she does make a veg one which is pure corn (but has butter and cheese). Please confirm if there are vegan options and let HappyCow know! Tell her you're veg, and she'll make big tamales loaded with seasonal vegetables for you, ready the next day. If you don't like spicy, make sure to tell her not to add chili.",
