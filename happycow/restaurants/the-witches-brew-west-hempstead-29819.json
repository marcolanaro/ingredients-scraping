  "description": "Operating since 1996, a coffee shop and cafe with a personality of its own of mismatched furniture, a game cupboard, and even the lighting (featuring old strung up Christmas lights) add to the laid back atmosphere. Also has a petite boutique selling trinkets and coffee beans. The menu features a variety of drinks, pastries, nachos, sandwiches, and full dinner menu. Has Wi-Fi and ATM onsite..",
