  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A small, cozy bakery that offers in-house-made breads, cakes, cinnamon rolls, cookies, granola, scones and veggie rolls. They also have a small menu that varies day by day. They always have a beans and rice bowl, veggie burritos and pizza by the slice or pie. Very friendly staff. They don't claim to be a vegetarian restaurant, but they don't serve meat. It's also right next to a health food store.",
