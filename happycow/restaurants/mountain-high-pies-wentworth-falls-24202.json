  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A local pie shop, has pies on the menu clearly marked as vegan, with offerings such as: tomato, coriander & lentil pie; dhansak & curried vegetables; and chickpea & curried veges with eggplant & coconut milk sauce. Sides such as mushy peas are also available. Juices, soft drinks, coffee (soy milk available). The shop is along the highway, with plenty of parking out the back. This shop is a little oasis from the usual of having to interrogate shop owners and getting vague responses about what's vegan or not.",
