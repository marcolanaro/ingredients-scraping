  "description": "This is a vegetarian wine bar offering vegetarian daily specials with a home-cooked taste. Beers and wines include a reasonably priced organic selection. The bar is below street level, and the walls show exhibitions of art or photography. The bar is run by women and definitely a place where women feel comfortable. If you arrive at 7pm, the day's food offering will be just being chalked onto the board. Portions are hearty. Some dishes are marked vegan.",
