  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Chain restaurant offering and extensive Indo-Chinese food menu, divided into vegetarian-possible and meat offerings. Many dishes come with choice of vegetable instead of meat. The restaurant is dark and cavernous but fills up on weekends. Be aware that each menu item is marked with up to 3 levels of spice using red dots, and even one red dot is hotter than most Americans prefer. The menu also indicates low calorie offerings and those that can be made \"dry\" (no sauce). Each table also has bottles with four kinds of sauces to vary the flavor options. The sauces are made by the company.",
