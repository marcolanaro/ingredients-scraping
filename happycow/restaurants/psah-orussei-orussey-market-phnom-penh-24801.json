  "description": "There are four vegetarian stalls at Orussey Market (stall 132, 133, 169, 170, all in one group toward south west corner of the food stall area). A couple of the stalls offer noodle soups, while the others have rice and mock meat dishes. Go early. You can also buy products at these stalls for home catering (mock pork floss, veg fish sauce, veg oyster sauce). Other products are for sale at a tiny stall situated somewhere along the inside northern wall of the market (mock duck, tofu, mock chicken drumsticks). Look out for the trays of tofu out the front of the stall. The vegetarian stalls are easy to find: they all have \"VEGETARIAN\" or variants thereof plastered across the front.",
