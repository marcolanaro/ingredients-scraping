  "description": "A small vegetarian take-away cafe situated in a pedestrian part of downtown Vevey. Menu includes sandwiches, salads, soups, creative takes on classics like lasagnas, etc. Mostly vegan but some dishes, clearly labeled as so, contain eggs. Interesting zero waste concept. Dishes are served in glass jars that can be brought back to have the deposit refunded. A few spots are available to eat in.",
