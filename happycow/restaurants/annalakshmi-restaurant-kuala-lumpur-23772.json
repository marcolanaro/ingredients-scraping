  "description": "Part of an international chain of Indian vegetarian restaurants. There are two restaurants at this location. Upstairs (inside) is fine-dining, accentuated with Indian art and handicrafts, with occasional classical dance and music performances. Downstairs (down the ramp to the car-park) is an inexpensive riverside cafe. The RM16 buffet is available Friday, Saturday, Sunday. It is run as a non-profit organization. Its adage is \"athithi devo bhava\" meaning \"the guest is God.\" This is a tribute to the Goddess of Plenty or Abundance, Annalakshmi.",
