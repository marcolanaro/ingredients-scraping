  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Cafe and gelato shop. Could get vegan antipasti and sides, including a hummus platter. The marinara sauce and the capellini pasta is vegan; all of the other pasta is made with egg. Could order a pasta dish with the capellini and omit parmesan. Pizza crust is also vegan, so cheese-less pizza is an option. Could also order 3 vegan sides in lieu of a meal (same pricing). Has vegan fruit sorbets.",
