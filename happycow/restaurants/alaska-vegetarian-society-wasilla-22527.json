  "description": "The Alaska Vegetarian Society was started in the fall of 2005 by Rays of Hope, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit group dedicated to creating a more compassionate and sustainable world. The goal of the Alaska Vegetarian Society is to support people who are already vegetarian or vegan and those who are moving toward or curious about a plant-based diet. We want to create a fun and open community where we can learn, socialize and work together to make this a safer, healthier, more compassionate world.",
