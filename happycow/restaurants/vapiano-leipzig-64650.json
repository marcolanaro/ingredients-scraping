  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Serves a menu that is suitable for vegans (as well as vegetarians, lactose free, gluten free, etc), including soups, salads, pasta, pizza and antipasti. Offers a unique kind of ordering; there's a stand for each kind of food and you go and order, at that point you tell the cook the meal you want and what ingredients from the original recipe he should not put in it, so it's easier that way, especially when you don't speak the language.",
