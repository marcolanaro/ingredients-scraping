  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Maya is located near the main train station square and they post their menu outside. There is a section of the menu for vegetarian options as well as noting that they can serve vegan if requested. Latin influenced both on menu and in decor. Considering the choices in Helsinki, it is surprising to see vegan printed on a posted menu.",
