  "description": "This small restaurant with 10 seats is run by a couple, and the food is 100% vegan. The menu is very simple, just a \"teishoku,\" like a \"menu of the day\". The number of food portions is limited, so reservation is suggested. On weekends, it's first come-first-served basis. Large drink menu is large, and vegan sweets are available. The \"teishoku\" costs approx. 1280 yen on weekdays, and 1380 weekends (drinks extra).",
