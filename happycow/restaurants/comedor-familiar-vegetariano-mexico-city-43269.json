  "description": "Vegetarian Mexican restaurant with only a small sign on the wall at street level, so can be easily missed. Homey cozy atmosphere, like someone's apartment with the living room converted into a dining space. Served comida corrida style, so it's a fixed menu with no a la carte options. Owners are knowledgeable about veganism and know which dishes are vegan or can be made vegan.",
