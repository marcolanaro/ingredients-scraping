  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Housed in an original train depot, this place is family friendly for early dinner or lunch but more adult crowd in evenings as this is a brewery restaurant. Extensive beer selection. Meat-centered menu with a few vegetarian ones, and a veggi burger that can be made vegan by omitting cheese.",
