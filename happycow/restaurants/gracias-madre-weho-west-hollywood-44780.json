  "description": "Organic Mexican food restaurant by the owners of Cafe Gratitude. Most of the produce used is grown on the owners' own local farm. Food is made-in-house in its open kitchen -- including the salsas, tamales, and corn tortillas. Concise seasonal menus. Prices moderate for the area but on the expensive end for a veg restaurant.",
