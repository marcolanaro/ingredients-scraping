  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Typical Szechuan Chinese restaurant with some vegan choices. Please advise staff you are vegan or vegetarian and they will help you. Vegan choices in the buffet are limited, so ordering from the menu is best. If you like spicy, ask for the made-in-house chili instead of the regular chili paste.",
