  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Cafe inside the Marina Paraiso Hotel, operating since Dec 2010. Staff can tell you what's vegan possible. The bagels are vegan, but the veggie burger patty is not as it contains egg. Offers salads and panini sandwiches and will accommodate veg requests. The kitchen soaks the vegetables in Microdyn (used to avoid certain \"digestive tourist\" issues). Previously located on Hidalgo Avenue, Oct 2015.",
