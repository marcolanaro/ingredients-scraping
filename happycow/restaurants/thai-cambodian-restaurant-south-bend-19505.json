  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Family-run restaurant making traditional Thai food along with Cambodian food, since 2005. While meat-based, one can ask for tofu and to leave out eggs. Does not use fish sauce or meat-broth (except in the coconut soup). Will substitute coconut milk for cream in the Thai iced tea/coffee.",
