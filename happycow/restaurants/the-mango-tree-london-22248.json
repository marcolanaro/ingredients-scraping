  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The Mango Tree, situated in the heart of Belgravia, a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace, is a part of London that will be forever Thailand. The back pages of the 20 plus page menu is where the Vegan section is with over 20 dishes. It's a lively place, but intimate enough for a special night out. Other locations are in Bangkok and Dubai. Note: Reportedly some vegetarian dishes may contain fish, check first before ordering- please inform HappyCow.",
