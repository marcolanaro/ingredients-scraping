  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Inside The View Hotel, this is one of 2 restaurants within 25 miles of Monument Valley. Once in the park, this restaurant is the only choice, as the pre-made food is not vegetarian. Serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The Navajo Taco, beans and chili are vegan suitable. There is also a salad bar, and at times, a vegetable soup. Beverages are non-alcoholic. When making reservation at the hotel or when passing through, call and ask to speak to the kitchen with requests.",
