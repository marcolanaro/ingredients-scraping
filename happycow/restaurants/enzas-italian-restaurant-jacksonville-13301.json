Vegan dishes are salad with house dressing, the garden pasta and the Sicilian pasta, or request pasta with oil and garlic, tomato or marinara sauce and have veggies of your choice added. Has a full bar. Tomato sauce is no longer vegan, but a veggie platter clearly marked \"vegan\" has been added to their menu.
