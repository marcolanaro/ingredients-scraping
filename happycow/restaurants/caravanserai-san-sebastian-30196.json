  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Spanish tapas and western cuisine. Has a tofu-seitan burger, fries, onion rings, salads, vegan pate on cracker, and a few other items are vegan or can be made vegan by asking for it without cheese (sin queso) or without eggs (sin huevos). Burgers do not come dressed with condiments, so no need to worry about non-vegan mayonnaise. Ambience is lively, dogs and children are welcome, and even though it's not the most Spanish of Spanish restaurants, you definitely feel you're in Spain and not a burger joint in the US.",
