  "description": "Re-opened in June 2010 as reported to HappyCow. Originally opened in the mid 70s as a pizza place and bakery then expanded into a full menu. The funky wall mural from the 70s captures that early veg spirit. Offers vegetarian comfort food. Many options, daily specials, and vegan soups. Small place with around 10 tables. Gets crowded for Sunday brunch.",
