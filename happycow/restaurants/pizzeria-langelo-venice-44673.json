  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Take-out pizza parlor offering vegan pizza and sandwiches with vegan cheese, mopur (a kind of seitan), and veggies. Sandwiches are also made with whole wheat. If the vegan pizza is not on display, you can expressly ask for it and they will make it. Sandwiches are made in the morning, so it is easier to find a larger choice at lunchtime rather than at dinnertime. Maybe difficult to find.",
