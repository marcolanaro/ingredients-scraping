  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The regular menu offers a handful of vegetarian entrees including butternut squash ravioli, a portobello sandwich, and a wild mushroom risotto. However, when asked, the staff is more than eager to modify the dishes (and even create new options) to accommodate vegans. They will even make new batches of some of the sauces and fillings without the non-vegan ingredients.",
