  "description": "Mainly a vegetarian juice bar that serves a few bowls and wraps. Other drinks include coffee and tea. Most smoothies and juices are vegan, but some do contain honey or bee pollen. Some vegan wraps are available and others can be made vegan by omitting egg or cheese. No indoor seating; outdoor seating is at picnic tables. Composts as much as possible.",
