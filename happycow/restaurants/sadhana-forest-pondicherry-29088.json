  "description": "An ecological project and vegan organic community that welcomes everyone to come and dine on 100% vegan whole food meals. Food is offered as a gift, no payment required. Daily breakfast from 8:30am, lunch 12:30pm, dinner 6pm. No dinner on Thursday or lunch on weekend. Directions: Take a bus leaving from Pondicherry bus park to Tindivanam. Get off at the Morattandi bus stop, and walk the opposite direction of bus travel on the road that runs alongside Hwy 66. (You'll go over four speed bumps to continue on this side road.) Take your first right and walk 20 minutes along the road (it will go from paved to dirt). You will reach a fork in the road which points to the right to Sadhana Forest. Continue walking until the road ends at Sadhana Forest.",
