Extensive menu includes unique dishes like South sea spice dried curry; tum kanoon made from jackfruit and spices; and tum makua, a well-seasoned eggplant salad. Authentic Thai cuisine is very spicy so be sure to request mild if necessary. Vegan selections are clearly marked, though food is stored and prepared with meat.",
