  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Upbeat retro-style diner. Has a vegan burger patty, gluten free bread (but maybe not vegan - ask), house-made falafel burger, and salads. The meat used is delivered already prepared, so there is no prepping in the kitchen. The vegan burgers also come in prepared and are kept in their own packaging until ready to be cooked. Grill is cleaned prior to cooking the vegan burgers.",
