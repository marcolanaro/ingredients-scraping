  "description": "Vegetarian Indian restaurant. Gujarati style cuisine featuring a thali special of 10-course combination platter for around $11 each person. Also has a small a la carte sides menu. Vegans may have a difficult time and should ask about ingredients because ghee butter and dairy is used in most dishes. No alcohol. Location is on the 2nd floor. Interior is decorated semi-formal with nice oversize furniture. Parking in lot or on the street.",
