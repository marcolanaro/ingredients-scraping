  "description": "Named after the owner's displayed collection of cat statues, this restaurant and bar near Racoczi Ter opened in 2010. Offers a changing daily menu, written in chalk on the beams of the funky DIY loft. Uses local and seasonable ingredients. Organic Hungarian wines, juices, house made syrups, and a range of Pálinkas. Art on exhibition which changes monthly. English-speaking staff, and a mostly young, local crowd.",
