  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Usually five soups on offer in addition to salads and bagel sandwiches. At least one soup is vegan, and a few are vegetarian.  All vegetarian and vegan items are clearly marked. The restaurant is small and pleasant, with slightly unusual seating. Location is right next to a large Alnatura, a German natural foods chain (sort of like a Whole Foods in the US). If you're in transit through Mainz, reckon on about 15 minutes to walk there from the main train station.",
