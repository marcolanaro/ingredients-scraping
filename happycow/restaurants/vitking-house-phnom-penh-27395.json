  "description": "Serene spot just south of the normal foreigner hangouts. Menu identical to Siem Reap counterpart: Asian focus with burgers, spaghetti, and a large selection of fresh-made drinks. Expect minimal English, and a  loyal young clientele of Chinese and Khmer locals. Note that the \"special\" on the bread menu usually means egg. Air conditioned seating on the middle level, rooftop dining available. Free Wi-Fi.",
