  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Small Thai restaurant located at the end of Storgata not far from Nerdstranda shopping mall. Peaceful atmosphere. There is a vegetarian/vegan menu with appetizers, main course, and dessert (not the same as the online menu). The food is traditional Thai food but it is made for Norwegian mouths, so if you like it spicy let them know. Most dishes are gluten free (ask to leave out soy sauce). Large portions.",
