  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Two local food carts. The one with the red umbrella and chairs makes Tam (pounded raw cucumber salad) and Veg Vietnamese style spring rolls. They usually put shrimp paste or a fish soy sauce on the salad so point to them and tell her no and 'no spicy' if you dont want it hot. The other cart vendor speaks English. Vegans, if you get there early she can make spring rolls with no egg. She uses fresh greens, carrots, mint, sometimes dried banana blossoms-just depends what she has. Cucumber salad is 10,000 kip and 4 spring rolls with peanut sauce is 5,000 kip. ",
