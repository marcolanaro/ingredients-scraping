  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Emphasis is on local, organic, and fair trade food. Neighborly casual atmosphere. Main dish salads, a veggie burger with tempeh that can be vegan by subbing sauerkraut or salsa or mustard for the chipotle mayonnaise. Reading material about revolutionizing our food system, a small retail market selling local produce, beer and wine (for take out only). Next door is their second restaurant, Della Zona which serves pizza and pasta using all the same principles as Village Bakery and is open Thur-Sat only. Two vegan cheeses available and many organic vegetable toppings.",
