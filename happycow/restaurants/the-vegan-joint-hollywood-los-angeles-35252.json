  "description": "The third Vegan Joint location, opened Nov 2012. Look for it on the 2nd floor of a corner shopping plaza (requires going up a set of stairs). Offers the same tasty fare including Thai favorites (curries and stir-frys with faux meat and veggies served with brown rice)  as well casual American classics (pancakes and hashbrown, veggie burgers with fries). Small and simple set-up.",
