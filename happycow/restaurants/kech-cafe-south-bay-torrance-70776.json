  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A small cafe in old Torrance. Serves coffee/espresso, smoothies, limited breakfast menu for vegans. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Several lunch/dinner items are accidentally/unintentionally vegan or easily can be made vegan. Just ask for what you want and if it's not pre-made with animal products they can easily omit or substitute items. Great place to study/work/meet-up. Has another location in Fountain Valley.",
