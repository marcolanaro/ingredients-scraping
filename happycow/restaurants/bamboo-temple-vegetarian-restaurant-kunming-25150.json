  "description": "Restaurant located inside the Bamboo Temple. Chinese speaking only but has an English menu, although some dishes are just described as \"beef\" or \"intestines\". No picture menu. Pay attention when you choose which tea to order as it may turn out more expensive than your meal. Nice atmosphere. Location is 7 kilometres northwest of Kunming city centre. Name in Chinese: 筇竹寺素斋馆. Address in Chinese: 近郊昆明西郊约7公里玉案山筇竹寺内.",
