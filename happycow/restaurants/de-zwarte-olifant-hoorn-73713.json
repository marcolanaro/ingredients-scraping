  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Has a couple vegan pies. For lunch and dinner a vegan Dutch weed burger is offered, plus has enough vegan ingredients to make a vegan dish. As of May 2016, there are very few vegan choices in this town so this is a good find. Is also a performance venue.",
