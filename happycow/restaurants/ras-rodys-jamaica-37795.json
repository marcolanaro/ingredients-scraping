Try the veg plate which consisted of a reggae stew of yams, carrots and other veggies, a serving of callaloo (the local greens), a serving of curried vegetables and a cabbage dish prepared in coconut milk, all on a bed of what's locally known as peas & rice, a combination of rice and small red beans.
