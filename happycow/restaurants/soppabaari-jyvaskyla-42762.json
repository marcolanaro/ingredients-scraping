  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The menu is flexible and thus not published beforehand on the website, but there is always at least one vegan alternative in both pasta and soup sections. The owners make the dish in request vegan, gluten-free, lactose-free. Examples of some vegan tapas include oven-baked potato slices, olives and tomato-basil spread for bread. Normal and special coffees and tea are served. Orange sorbet is a suitable dessert for vegans. An easy-going atmosphere with pillows, candles and Finnish design and art.",
