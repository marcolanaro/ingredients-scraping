Events are held at additional times during the week and a set 3 course menu (3 choices minimum for each course) for Â£12 when there is no event on Saturday evenings. Roughly 40% of food is vegan. Food is home cooking style made-in-house. As well as smaller tables there is often a large table to socialize with other diners.",
