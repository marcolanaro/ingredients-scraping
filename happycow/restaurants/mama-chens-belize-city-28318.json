  "description": "Mostly vegan, some things with egg. The family that owns and runs the restaurant and also runs the adjacent guesthouse (approx. $30US/ night). Chow mein noodle, drinks with tapioca boba bubbles, soymilk made in-house, and more. Note: might charge you $1BZ (50 cents US) for sharing food and unlike most small eateries in Belize, this restaurant does add tax to the bill. Best time to go is around lunch time when they have more available options. Has air conditioning.",
