  "description": "They are artisan bakers specializing in one single loaf of bread - a hearty, yet light country French loaf, created in the tradition of the 18th century. The bakers begin the loaves with a sourdough starter that Nyberg, the owner, has been nurturing for more than 20 years. To unbleached King Arthur Sir Galahad flour he adds organic emmer, kamut, spelt, rye, and hard red winter wheat. He  buys emmer from Oechsner Farms in Newfield NY, and the other grains from Champlain Valley Milling in Westport NY. Filtered tap water and sea salt are the only other ingredients.",
