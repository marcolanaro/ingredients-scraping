  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A cozy/comfortable neighborhood coffee and beer cafe with constantly changing craft beers. As of March 2016, there are no vegetarian or vegan restaurants in the area. This cafe offers 4-5 vegan choices, per the owner's decision to add them. There is a thai noodle salad, avocado wrap, a few other salads, sandwiches, and, depending on the day, vegan soup. The entire menu is limited, so having this many choices makes up around 40% of the menu.  Located on the main drag near the college. Parking is abundant, although there are meters. Many people walk because it is near the college and shopping.",
