  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. As of April 2015, one of the very few places in Bay City that offers vegan dishes. All vegan items are clearly marked on menu, including pizza with veggies and Teese vegan cheese and a sundried tomato pesto pasta dish. Also you can ask for the garlic knots to be made vegan (they use EVOO instead of butter and serve with a vegan red sauce). You can make your own vegan pizza, where you pay extra per topping and they make it with Teese. ",
