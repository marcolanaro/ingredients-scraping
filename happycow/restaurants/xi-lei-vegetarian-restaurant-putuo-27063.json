  "description": "Chinese name 息耒素斋馆, address 普陀区普陀山香华街3号(普济寺旁边). There is no indication in English about a vegetarian restaurant, it has a restaurant sign with the name in Chinese, and there is a lady standing near the door arches who will usher the way inside. The ambiance is a typical Chinese restaurant setting. There are quite a number of people during dinner time but still some seats left. Smoking is permitted. Dishes are moderate to expensive for locals, moderate for tourists. Plenty of vegan options.",
