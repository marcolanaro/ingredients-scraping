  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The sign outside of this strip mall eatery reads \"Asian Food.\"  Inside is an odd Route 66-styled roadhouse. The menu has a vegetarian section, and tofu is available, but nothing specifically mentions vegan. If you move outside of the vegetarian section, ask about fish sauce use. Not much else for veg food in the vicinity.",
