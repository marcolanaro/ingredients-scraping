  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Located in North Austin where very few places offer vegan dishes; about half the dishes are vegan here, but are not clearly labeled. You pick out your food from behind a bar, and if you order the veggie (vegan) plate, it comes on two full-sized plates, is $11.99 (as of March 2016) and consists of 15 different items. Also has vegan pasties (greens and onion), and zataar flatbread pizzas (vegan). You can also order a falafel plate (falafel is not part of the veggie platter), or vegan appetizers.",
