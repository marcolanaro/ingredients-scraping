  "description": "Little vegetarian bar. Offers a selection of bottled vegan smoothie and cold pressed juices, and has coffee with house-made almond  or hazelnut milk. Vegans could get a raw dessert, cookies, pumpkin soup with coconut milk, toast with pepper and vegan pesto, salad with rice and avocado, hummus with vegetables, and a porridge. Some things contain dairy, so ask. Food is mostly ready made, and you could ask the staff to warm it up.\r\n",
