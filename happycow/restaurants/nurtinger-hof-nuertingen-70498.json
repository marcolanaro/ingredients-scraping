  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Finding a restaurant suitable for vegans in a small Swabian town is not always easy task, but this is one place. Menu lists clearly labeled vegan dishes and the staff knows about them. Other ingredients (e.g. eggs, nuts, soy products) are also labelled. Uses fresh ingredients from the region. The atmosphere is modern and clean,  and there's a corner with books and toys for children.",
