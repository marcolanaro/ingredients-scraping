  "description": "Operating out of the Himalayan Heritage Restaurant last Sunday of the month from 12-3pm, this is a volunteer-driven experiment in generosity. Pay it forward, pay as you like service where there are no prices on the menu and where the check reads $0.00 with only this footnote: \"Your meal was a gift from someone who came before you. To keep the chain of gifts alive, we invite you to pay it forward for those who dine after you.\" You get a fixed menu: 3 vegetarian entrees, rice, dal, naan, and dessert. Ask for re-fills if you like. Uses dairy.",
