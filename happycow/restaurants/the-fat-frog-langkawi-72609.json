  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Menu offers a wide range of healthier and vegetarian-friendly dishes, with soups, salads, pasta, and curry. There is also a daily specials board with the day's quiche, salad, and cake. The atmosphere changes through the day, with a casual feel through the breakfast and lunch hours then turning to chilled bali-esque sunset tunes setting the tone for cocktails and beers on the terrace before nightfall and soft uplighting makes dinner a more intimate affair.",
