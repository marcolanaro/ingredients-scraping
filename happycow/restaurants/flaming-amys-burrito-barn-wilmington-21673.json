  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Has vegetarian burritos like the Thai-me-up, tree hugger, and veggie deluxe; plus one vegan burrito. Or you can substitute a grilled fillin (eggplant, portabello mushroom, and two types of tofu) in place of meat. Most items can be made to order. There is a fresh salsa bar. Daiya vegan cheese is available for extra up-charge. Quirky and fun atmosphere with a game room for children.",
