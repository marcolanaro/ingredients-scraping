  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Alesund in winter is a hard place for vegetarians and vegans, practically impossible if wheat-free. This nice little restaurant is not vegetarian, but unlike many in the town, it does actually have some meat-free / fish-free starters and the staff will work with you to find something you can eat. Also Hummer & Kanari restaurant further up the street offers a couple meat-free dishes. NOTE: maybe closed/shut down, please verify and let HappyCow know.",
