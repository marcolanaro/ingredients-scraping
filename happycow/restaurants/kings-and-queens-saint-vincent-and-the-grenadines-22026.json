  "description": "A Rastafarian Ital shop run by Ras Imani and his family. Offers several lunch options daily, including veggie burgers, soya chunks roti, veggie pizza, soup, the Ital Lunch, and cakes. Most meals are EC$5-EC$7, local juice is EC$2-EC$3, and a slice of cake is only EC$1. Try the Ital lunch and the beetroot juice. Possibly the only item that has dairy is the veggie pizza. It is located in a small wooden shop painted in Rastafarian colors. From the Central Market in Kingstown, walk across Bay Street to Frisko's Ice Cream stand. Walk past Frisko's into the area with all the shops. Take your first left, and Kings and Queens will be on your left.  Open almost every day, unless owners are on vacation.  Call ahead to see.",
