  "description": "Small, completely vegetarian stand that serves Taiwanese street food snacks such as shaved ice, Taiwan style soy milk, stuffed cakes, and Taiwanese empanadas (a better description would be savory pancakes). The pancakes, soy milk and shaved ice (provided you only get fruit toppings and say no to the condensed milk) are vegan. Only one very small table. This is purely a grab-and-go type place. Directly across the street from La Esquina Asiatica.",
