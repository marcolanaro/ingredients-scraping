  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Offers at least 1 vegan choice in every menu section, including a daily soup and 2 desserts (such as banana brulee cheesecake). All items clearly marked as vegan or vegetarian. Some of the vegetarian items, like the veggie burger and the veggie pizzas, can be made vegan. Omit the bun and the veggie burger is vegan. Vegan cheese available for the pizza. Confirmed by Chef Rita, who also said there is a vegan sushi roll (not on the online menu). Gluten-free options as well. Big on sustainability and locally grown and harvested foods, some organic. Some of the restaurant is even made out of recycled resources. Spacious cafe with open kitchen, so you can see your food being prepared. As of Sept 2014, the only place on campus to get a decent vegan meal.",
