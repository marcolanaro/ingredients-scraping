  "description": "Menu is typical Gujarati, with plenty of options for vegans and those who eat cheese. It is quite close to a large Jain community, so specificity about vegan dishes will not confuse the staff one bit. The menu is primarily what they call \"snack food,\" and many of the dishes can easily serve as a small meal - combine a couple plates and you'll be plenty satisfied.  Think of it as tapas, if you're coming from the West. The restaurant is part of a small boutique hotel and is centrally located across from Sidi Saiyad Mosque.",
