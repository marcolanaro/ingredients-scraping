  "description": "Vegetarian Indian fast food with many vegan options. The dishes are pre-made and kept warm in a glass steamtable. You order at the counter. A combo with 3 curries/dishes, white rice, and bread costs around $8.50 (extra for brown rice). Offers soy yogurt for vegans. There's also a small chaat menu (samosas, pani puri, bhel puri). Casual, clean-lines decor with a large wooden communal table in the center of the dining area. Parking in lot behind or on the street in front. Same owners as Bhahat Baazar, but this location is restaurant only and no Indian groceries.",
