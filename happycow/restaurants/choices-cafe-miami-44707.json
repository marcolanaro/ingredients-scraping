Offers fusion versions of American staples such as burgers, pizza, sandwiches and salads, while still including ubiquitous worldly offerings such as mushroom quesadilla and nori seaweed wraps. Exotic meals embrace Latin American spices like cayenne pepper and delicacies like cactus, and even Indian and Asian essences, such as curried or ginger-miso soups. Free Wi-Fi. Since Jan 2014.",
