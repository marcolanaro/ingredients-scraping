  "description": "Taohuayuan (桃花源) is the latest and fifth vegetarian restaurant at Chung Cheng University. It is a very nice restaurant for this area. It is built and decorated with railroad tiles and furnished with wooden furniture. It serves a variety of Western and Chinese vegetarian food, but is (surprisingly) not a Buddhist establishment, so they do use garlic and onions unless you ask them not to do so. Full set meals range from 120 to 180NT$. As the prices are more than double that of the others in the area, it is usually only frequented by professors and grad students. The restaurant also doubles as a cafe and serves various drinks throughout the day.",
