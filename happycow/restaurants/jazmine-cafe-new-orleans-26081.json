  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Vietnamese food restaurant. Menu includes vegan salad rolls, veg soups, noodle bowls, and appetizers. Try the tofu avocado bowl (served with vegan peanut sauce), mushroom glass noodle soup, or vegetarian \"sweet heat\". Note that some dishes that otherwise appear vegetarian may be served with fish sauce on the *side*. You can always ask for hoison or peanut sauce instead. Staff know what soups are made with vegetable broth, and if you tell them you are a vegetarian they will serve you a complementary (vegan) side salad with your meal instead of the usual chicken-based soup.",
