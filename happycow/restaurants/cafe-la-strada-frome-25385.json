  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. This is mainly a coffee and ice cream shop that also sells a small range of meals and snacks. Around 50% of the menu is vegetarian but what makes it a 'must' for vegans in the area are the vegan 'water-ices' (sorbets) that they make. Usually at least three in a variety of flavors, which keeps changing. Soya milk is available for coffee and tea.",
