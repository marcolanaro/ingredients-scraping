  "description": "Small vegetarian takeaway situated near to the station and the Laines. Offers breakfast and lunch. Baked goods are made using low-gluten and gluten free flours, and all cakes are vegan. Meals are made to order so if you ask, the kitchen will veganize a dish or cater to a food allergy or intolerance. Breakfast dishes include pancakes and gado gado, while lunch might be a thali-style lunchbox or spelt-base pizza to go. Everything is soy-free.",
