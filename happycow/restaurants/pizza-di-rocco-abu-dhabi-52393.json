  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Pizzeria making authentic Italian pizza cooked in a handmade cupola-style oven. Attention is paid to interior decor and feel: cupboard filled with pizza books, pictures and different oils; lots of plates on the walls; table with herbs in little glass jars, flowers, music, and cutlery in a small bucket. Vegans could get the bruschetta, garlic bread, salad insalata di rocco (omit goat cheese), Greek salad (omit cheese), green salad. For pizza there's whole wheat or white-flour dough with tomato sauce and choice of fresh vegetable toppings and option to omit cheese. Call ahead if you'd like for the kitchen to provide vegan cheese on your pizza. The location is tucked between the car rental and auto accessories shops.",
