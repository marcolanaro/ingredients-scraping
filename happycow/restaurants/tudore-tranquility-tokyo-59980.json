Soft lighting, soothing music, and abstract art combine to create a subtle, elegant, and tranquil atmosphere. The ever-changing 8-course dinner features palate cleansers, naturally sweetened fruit and vegetable based desserts, and original cocktails. Handpicked wines accompany each of the individually plated dishes. A 5-course brunch is served on Sunday. Private parties for minimum 15 guests can be accommodated.",
