Vegans can get the Thai wrap when substituting tofu for chicken, linguini with Italian red sauce by omitting cheese, nori maki vegetable sushi (when available), sesame noodle salad, edamame, Thai curry noodles with vegetables and tofu. There are several other lacto-veg items on the menu. Fast service.",
