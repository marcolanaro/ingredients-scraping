  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A Lebanese restaurant focused on making hummus with different toppings. This place has mostly vegetarian dishes and a few vegan ones. Serves a vegan salad of the day as well. The atmosphere is very quiet as the restaurant is located in a smaller part of Palma, right by Santa Catalina Market. The owner speaks really good English and is very engaged and enthusiastic about his customers. ",
