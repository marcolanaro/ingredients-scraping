  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Pakwan serves all of your standard Indian dishes in a pleasant atmosphere with friendly staff. They understand what \"vegan\" means, and have advertized on their sign several times \"Vegans Welcome\". If you tell them you're vegan, they will cook your food separately. The manager is very friendly and has prepared special meals for the local vegan group. Offers a buffet that is recommended, especially on the weekend.",
