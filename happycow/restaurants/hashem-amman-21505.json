Offers a very basic menu of Jordanian staples like falafel, hummus, fuul, french fries, pita bread, plus all-you-can-eat raw tomato slices, onion, and mint leaves as condiment. Drinks are limited to bottled water, chai, mint tea, and coke. There is a small cluster of restaurants in this area, and the place on its left also serves vegetarian food.",
