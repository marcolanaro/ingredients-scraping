  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A budget bio restaurant, billed as 'restaurant vegetarian a Amiens' but with a mixed menu, mainly vegetarian options, including lots of different salads. Uses egg and dairy. Customers serve themselves and pay before finding a seat in a small, tightly-packed room. Busy at lunchtime so it may be necessary to share a table.",
