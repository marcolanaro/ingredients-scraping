  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Oulu is a touristic city with very few choices for vegetarians. This place is located in the city center by the Tori market place. More upscale decor. Primarily meat-centric but does offer some vegetable dishes - tell the staff what you'd like and be sure to specify 'no chicken sauce,' and 'no oyster sauce' if you order the mushroom with bamboo.",
