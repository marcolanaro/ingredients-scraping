Lunch is Japanese style comprising several small dishes, served from 12-2pm; other times it's a cafe. Brown rice and miso soup are staples. Uses seitan, no refined sugar. Barley tea, coffee, or tea offered with meal. One sweet option. Also sells a small selection of grocery items, some pottery, arts and crafts. The space has an earthy feel, with a small balcony that overlooks Oita castle. Holds meditation sessions and casual English conversation events some evenings.",
