  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. An outside cafe in Makawao town center (no indoor seating). The owner usually runs the cafe herself with a helper in the kitchen. Food is served quickly in to-go ware only. If you specify your veg/vegan requests, she will accommodate. For example, in the quinoa & grilled eggplant salad you can request to omit cheese, as same with the grilled eggplant sandwich. Her husband bakes the foccacia bread used for the sandwiches, and that's made without dairy or eggs. The daily soup is sometimes vegan. There is also a Asian sesame salad plus you can request an avocado sandwich without cheese or mayonaise.",
