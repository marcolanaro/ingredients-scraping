  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Quiet and small Mexican restaurant right off Ridge Rd. The menu offers the standard meat options, and the staple Mexican food with beans and cheese, or with just beans if tell them. There is a vegetable burrito, a veggie chicken sandwich, a veggie hamburger. You can order the tacos, taco salad, burritos, and chimichangas with just beans. Any of the basic mexican items you may want can be prepared with soy protein crumbles, as a substitute for the beef. Complimentary fresh salsa served. Quick service.",
