  "description": "This restaurant is 50 meters east of the 3-way intersection at Doan Thi Nghiep. My Tho has a confusing system of street addresses running consecutively (274, 275 and 276 sit side-by-side). Quan Chay Huong Thien sits opposite 678 Ly Thuong Kiet. The restaurant itself is tiny, with just a handful of tables and a small Vietnamese-only menu featuring mostly soups and rice and noodle dishes. Their specialty is banh xeo, a rice pancake folded in half, filled with soy bean sprouts and veggies and served with fresh greens (used for wrapping and for filling) and a dipping sauce.",
