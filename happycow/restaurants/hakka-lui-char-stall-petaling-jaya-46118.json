  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. This restaurant offers only one dish: Hakka lui cha (thunder tea rice), a traditional dish consisting of a bowl of rice with vegetables and nuts alongside a bowl of soup prepared from green tea and mint leaves. Tea soup is typically made with chicken stock, but this place makes its tea soup vegan. The only non-vegan ingredient is ikan bilis (dried anchovies) that can be added as a condiment. Request for vegetarian (\"sayuran\"), and you get the tofu-based variety of that condiment.",
