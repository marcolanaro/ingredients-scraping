The menu is full of traditional authentically made freshly prepared noodle dishes, soup, salads and curries - all the veggie options are vegan as they don't use any dairy or egg. The desserts are the only thing not made in-house and are not all vegan. They serve alcohol and freshly squeezed juices.",
