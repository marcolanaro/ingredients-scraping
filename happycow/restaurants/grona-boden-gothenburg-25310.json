  "description": "Gr√∂na Boden is vegetarian and vegan health food store with an eclectic mix of fresh local organic produce, Swedish favorites, and Japanese imports. Sells tofu, seaweed, and vegan substitutes. Also has eco-friendly cleaning products and other unusual products. Behind the counter is a large collection of medicines and beauty products which are all not tested on animals. Connected with the Life franchise of health stores (lifebutiken.se) but unlike any other Life store you may have visited-it is not typical for Life stores to sell food, for instance.",
