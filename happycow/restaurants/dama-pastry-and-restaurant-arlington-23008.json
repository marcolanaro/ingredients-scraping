  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Ethiopian restaurant in the DC area. Offers vegan versions of some traditional meat dishes. You can get a veggie steak sandwich, kitfo (chopped seitan with greens and tofu soft \"cheese\"), dulet (chopped seitan, with peppers, onions, and spices from the kitfo), tibs (larger pieces of seitan sauteed in either mild spices or berbere sauce), doro wat (seitan on a chopstick \"bone\" with a tofu-based \"hard boiled egg\" in berbere sauce). The veggie combo varies day to day and is enough food for 2 or 3 people. Casual place, more about the food than the ambiance. Service sometimes be slow, but the food usually comes quickly. Note: The bakery next door usually has 1-3 kinds of vegan cake, and always has vegan cookies plus baklava (made with honey). Soy milk is available to make vegan cappuccino and other coffee drinks.",
