  "description": "Inside the courtyard of a yoga and retreat center compound, you'll find several, small veg food stands, a couple shops selling health food products, an herbal doctor offering treatments, and a gym. It's tucked away and difficult to find. Also known as 'Baan Aree' (Ari house) or 'Banana Family Park.' Directions: Take exit 1 from Ari Station, walk 3 minutes towards the ESSO service station, immediately before ESSO you will see an alleyway with 'Banana Family Park' on the wall in bright letters, walk up this alleyway and continue through the complex as if you are going to exit out through the back, and you will find all the vegetarian stalls and health shop right at the back. Re-opened after brief closure Mar 2016.",
