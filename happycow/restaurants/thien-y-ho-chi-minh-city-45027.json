  "description": "Large open Buddhist vegetarian restaurant in Binh Thanh District. All food is vegan, but may offer dairy milk for coffees and such. Fairly typical of many of the type, with Buddhist imagery around the walls and a small garden. Facilities are generally basic, but the atmosphere is calming. It has the typical wide range of food and drink options, including noodle, rice and hot pot dishes.",
