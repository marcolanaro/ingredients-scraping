  "description": "KraftWerket Folkekøkken People's Kitchen volunteers serve vegan food on Tuesday 6-7pm (come early before food is gone). A plate usually costs around 20 kr. On the first Tuesday of the month a dessert is offered with the same price. The other Tuesdays, snacks are on the tables. It's possible buy beer and soda. Water and bread is free. There's also a little vegan shop selling a few kitchen and home essential items. Located 5-minute walk from Valby station. Check its webpage before you go to be sure that it's open the week you want to go.",
