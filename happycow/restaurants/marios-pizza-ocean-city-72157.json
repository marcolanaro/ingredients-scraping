Could order a grilled veggie sub with vegan cheese (note shared grill, though). The minestrone soup is vegan. Garden salad can be ordered with a vegan dressing (olive oil & vinegar, balsamic vinaigrette). Vegan pasta varieties are spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, penne, and rigatoni. Vegan sauces are tomato, mushroom, aglio & oglio (garlic, olive oil), fradiavolo (hot marinara). Be sure to specify vegan so kitchen doesn't garnish your food.",
