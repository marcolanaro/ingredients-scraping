  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Bar atmosphere with carved wood decor. A few vegan items plus vegetarian ones that can be made vegan. All food is locally sourced from Michigan farms, and menu changes seasonally. Dishes are made-in-house. Ask staff for  suggestions. Sunday is brunch and may not have any vegan dishes, so call ahead. Tuesdays the kitchen does not carry the regular menu, but instead allows local budding chefs or restaurateurs to borrow the kitchen for a pop-up. Full bar with local beers. Mon-Wed kitchen closes at 9pm; Thur-Sat kitchen closes at 10pm.",
