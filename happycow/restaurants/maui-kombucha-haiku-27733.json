The only non-vegan item is bee pollen which is an ingredient in an occasional dessert, so vegans please inquire. Features made-in-house kombucha on tap. A refrigerator case is filled throughout the day with grab-n-go raw entrees (pizza, wrap, hummus platter) along with raw desserts and chocolate. Small interior with ample seating.",
