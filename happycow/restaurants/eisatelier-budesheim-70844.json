  "description": "An ice cream parlor/cafe offers vegan fruit ice cream such as mango, strawberry, black currant, white peach and others. Try the black nero Italian chocolate ice cream. On weekends also has made-in-house cakes (not vegan). The name Atelier is due to the fact that a local artist shows his pictures that are for sale.",
