  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. This may the the closest restaurant to Point Reyes that is truly vegan friendly. The restaurants within Point Reyes Station have very limited vegan fare. There are two vegan restaurants in the general area, but these are over twice as far away from Point Reyes Station (21+ miles vs 10 miles actual driving distance). The several vegan choices on the menu here are clearly marked. All the vegetarian items are organic. It is located in the small town of Lagunitas. The cafe itself is small, but there is plenty of additional seating outside. The place is pleasant and service is friendly. The food is typical Indian, but organic.",
