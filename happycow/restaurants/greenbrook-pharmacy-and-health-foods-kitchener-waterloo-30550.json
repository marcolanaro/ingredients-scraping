  "description": "Greenbrook Health Foods carry many vegan products such as Vega protein powders, Daiya, Yves Cuisine, Udo's Oils, Breeze Almond Milks, hemp cereals, and vegan chocolate chips. If there is a product you would like and you don't find it they will take the time to find out if they can order it in for you. The products are comparatively priced with other local natural food stores, plenty of options for vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free foods. Glutino, Udi's and Ezekiel breads are just a couple of their offerings. ",
