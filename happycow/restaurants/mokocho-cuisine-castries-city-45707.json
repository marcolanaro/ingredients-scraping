  "description": "Serves mostly vegan food and juices to the local population in a self-built small wooden restaurant near the Castries fruit and vegetable market. It is in the 2nd row of little shops across the road from Castries Carpark. Limited seating. Get there before 8am for breakfast as it sells out quickly to local workers. Get there before 2pm to get some choices for lunch. Keeps serving drinks and snacks even when all the main food has sold out.",
