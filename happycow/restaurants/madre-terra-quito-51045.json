  "description": "A small, home-style Ecuadorian vegetarian restaurant serving daily set lunch menus. Two small dining rooms upstairs in an old building. The entrance is easy to miss, so look for the small sign hanging perpendicular to an open doorway on Luis Cordero, a few doors west of Mariscal Foch crossing. Specify if you are vegan as sometimes uses dairy.",
