  "description": "Vegetarian Persian food using local and organic whenever possible. Menu changes and always features different rice with hearty stew variations. Try the pomegranate and walnut stew over jewel basmati rice. A la carte and full meals are available to order. The chocolate is not vegan. No tables inside, but there is a courtyard where you can eat. Owners are happy to give samples.",
