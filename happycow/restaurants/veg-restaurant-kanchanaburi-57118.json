  "description": "A simple, buffet style veggie restaurant offering 6 or so dishes that vary daily and seem to be all-vegan. Dishes are local-style spicy, but you can taste before you pick. Free drinking water. No English name but recognizable by the yellow jay flag. Sells soy-protein crispy snacks, meat substitutes. Directions: Walk away from the bridge over the River Kwai all the way across the tourist street until the road bends to the left where the CJ supermarket is; walk around 30 meters on the left side and you'll find it.",
