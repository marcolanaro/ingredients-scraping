  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. American breakfast joint, with a hometown feel. Main menu is typical breakfast fare, but tucked away on the smaller paper menu are choice of vegan pancakes. The staff will confirm if you want vegan butter with your pancake order, and kitchen will cook home fries on a clean area of the cooker as well. Gets busy.",
