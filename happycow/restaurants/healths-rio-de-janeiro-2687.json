  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Located near the National Library and the State Theatre. Downstairs is the vegetarian section and upstairs a normal buffet, but the upstairs may have better vegetarian options. Also, meat items are situated in separate area from the vegetarian / vegan items. Probably not a good place for someone who doesn't know the language.",
