  "description": "Little teahouse in the back streets of St. Michel, 5-minute walk from the city center. The menu is small, just a few items written on a chalkboard sign, with always a vegan option, and you could ask to make you something vegan if you don't see it on the menu. The vegan tart du jour comes with a salad and whole-grain bread. A bowl of soup is often puree of vegetable. Offers tisane (herb tea), coffee, and black tea. The ambiance is funky but pleasant. It's a cooperative, so you'll find lots of left-leaning reading material (in French) and well-worn, coffeehouse style furniture. After 5pm only warm drinks and cake.",
