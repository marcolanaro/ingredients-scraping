  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Mexican restaurant in the Neustadt. Authentically decorated but the food isn't too spicy. There are vegetarian options for tacos, fajitas, quesadillas, etc. The only one vegan item is the fajitas -- get four dips with them and instead of getting sour cream and cheese and get two helpings of guacamole and salsa sauce.",
