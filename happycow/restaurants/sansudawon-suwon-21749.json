  "description": "Open since 2007, Sansudawon is a traditional cafe. May have only a couple vegan choices. The owner, who speaks a little English, also offers cooking classes, yoga classes, and traditional tea ceremony classes. An oasis for vegetarians in Suwon, if a little more expensive than your usual Korean style restaurant.",
