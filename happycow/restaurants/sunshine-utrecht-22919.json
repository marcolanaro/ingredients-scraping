  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Ethiopian food. For vegans this is a good option if you want to eat something other than the standard Asian veggie food in Utrecht. The menu has a vegetarian section and it is easy to order a completely vegan meal since cheese and fish (tuna) are listed specifically. It is run by a family that actively promote the Ethiopian culture and want to inspire people to visit their home country, so they are always talking to people about Ethiopia and showing them pictures and guidebooks (after you are done eating).",
