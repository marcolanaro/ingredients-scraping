  "description": "Serves the typical mock meat Chinese food including rice dishes, noodles, tempura, vegetable dishes--with a modern take. Tiny place with air-con and is pleasant and clean. Little to no English spoken. Directions: Go in the entrance on Monireth Boulevard, to the right of the Lucky Supermarket entrance. Go up one floor using the escalators on your right hand side. Turn left towards the middle of the mall and then take the first right lane- you will see double doors leading outside. Go outside (it looks like you're heading for the car park) and the restaurant is on your left hand side. It's now on the first floor in a beautiful newly designed space. There are private dining rooms available too.",
