  "description": "As of April 2015, a small food cart that serves 100% vegan Thai food. Everything is written in Thai but you can see the Thai word for vegan - it looks like GI but mirrored. Serves vegan laap with mushrooms and soy protein as substitutes. Comes with sticky rice for only 40 baht (April 2015). Take away possible, although you'll get the laap and rice separately in plastic bags (no foam).  Menu may change throughout the year. Does not speak English but is helpful and smiles a lot.",
