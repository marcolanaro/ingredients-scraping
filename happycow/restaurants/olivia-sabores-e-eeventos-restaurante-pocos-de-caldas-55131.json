Staff will be happy to customize meals especially for vegans and vegetarians; please just ask. Wi-fi. Note from happycow: since there is no website or fb page or menu online, we could not find a menu to see if any forbidden meats (veal, foie gras, lamb, liver) are served - if anyone can inform us, please do - thank you.",
