  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. France does not have that many restaurants which recognize vegetarians, and especially ones that serve tofu properly, and ones which do spicy dishes like bibimbop are rare. This restaurant offers several vegetarian options that unlike most in France do not involve cheese. Swedish owned and operated.",
