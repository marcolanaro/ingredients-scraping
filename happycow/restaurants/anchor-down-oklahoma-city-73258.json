  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Located in Bricktown is a laid-back corn dog joint with a slightly modern edge (it's in a converted cargo container). Vegan choices include naked tater tots, the guard dog (2 Field Roast dogs dipped in vegan masa batter, served with maple mustard and made-in-house-chips) and the tree hugger (a salad of spring mix greens, sliced Field Roast, avocado, tomato, cucumber, black bean corn relish, tortilla strips, and maple mustard). The patio has plenty of seating and games, and the beer variety (including excellent local brews) is large. As of May 2016, a number of the youthful & attentive staff are vegan and are cognizant of adding more vegan options.",
