  "description": "Like El Tahrir, Abu Tarek serves only one dish: koshary/kushari which is a traditional Egyptian vegetarian dish made with chickpeas, lentils, tomato sauce, vinegar, fried onions, rice, and noodles (which is almost always vegan). The kushari at Abu Tarek is reportedly vegan, and your only choice when ordering is what size (small or large). Vegans ask about beverages. ",
