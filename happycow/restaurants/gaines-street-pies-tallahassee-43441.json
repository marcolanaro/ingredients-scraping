  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Low-style comic book atmosphere with pop comic murals on walls and a different comic decoupage on each table. Serves pizza, wraps, sandwiches, salads and calzones with multiple vegan and gluten-free choices, including Daiya cheese. Vegetarian pizzas are noted on menu, easy to substitute for vegan. Ask staff about which sauces are vegan. Try the vegan foxy cleopatra which is a hummus base, artichokes, roasted red peppers, swirls of sun dried tomato sauce, and kalamata olives.",
