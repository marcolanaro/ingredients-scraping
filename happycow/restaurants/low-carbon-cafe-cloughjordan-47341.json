  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Situated in a community centre for arts and crafts called The Makery, cafe strives to reduce dependency on fossil fuels by selecting locally grown wild, organic and biodynamic ingredients in the most unprocessed states. Using traditional techniques from cultures all over the world, produces freshly cooked, in-house-made food. Menu changes every two weeks. Has vegan choices as well as eggless, nut-free, raw and gluten free. Only offers fish or other forms of meat if it has been reared biodynamically, and this is quite rare. If meat is served, chef makes sure that the odors do not bother other customers.",
