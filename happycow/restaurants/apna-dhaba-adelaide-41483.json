  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Vegetarian Indian restaurant, Chatpata and Dhaba style food. Some Indo-Chinese dishes. A lot of the dishes contain dairy (yogurt, butter or cheese), so if you are vegan you will need to request advice from staff about what to order. Previously 100% vegetarian restaurant, but now serves meat, June 2014. Please let HappyCow know if veg-options are good enough to continue to list this business.",
