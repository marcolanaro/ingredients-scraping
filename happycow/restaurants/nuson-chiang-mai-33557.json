  "description": "Buddhist veg buffet just outside the old city in the southeast corner right side of Kamphaeng Din rd - look for a red and yellow Veg sign. Food is vegan, though some pre-made baked items contain egg - ask. Buffet food is cooked and placed in steamtable so you can see the dishes; no menu. Offers house-made gluten and tofu dishes, plus also baked goods and cookies, sandwiches, fresh spring rolls. Owner speaks some English. Spacious and airy compared to other Thai veg places. Nov 2015 reported still operating but maybe difficult to find.",
