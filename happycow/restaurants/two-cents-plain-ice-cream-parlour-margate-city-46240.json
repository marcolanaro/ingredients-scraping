  "description": "Family-run business opened in 1974. Owner's daughter is a vegan and so offers a complete vegan menu which includes shakes, smoothies, fruit bowls and banana whips as well as vegan toppings such as assorted nuts, fruits, coconut, vegan choc chips and more. All shakes have a frozen banana base and are blended in a Vitamix which is used for vegan menu items ONLY. Shakes are made with almond milk but there is rice milk available for those with nut allergies. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a very old style parlour with original wallpaper that blends perfectly with the black and white checked tile floor and in-house-made fountain sodas.",
