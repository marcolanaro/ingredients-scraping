  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Chain of pub/restaurants - be warned that it's a carvery and is primarily meatstuff, but it's an option to go with non-veg diners. At lunch you will find around 4 vegetarian dishes, of which maybe 2 are vegan suitable. Vegan dishes might be an allotment pie (butternut squash, parsnip, mushroom, spinach & chestnuts with garlic & nutmeg in chive pastry) and a curried veg bake (cauliflower, green lentils, sweet potato cooked in Indian spices topped with potato, okra & nigella seeds). Could also order a few sides to make a meal, like roast potatoes, stuffing, apple sauce, cranberry sauce, mint sauce, etc. Ask about butter.",
