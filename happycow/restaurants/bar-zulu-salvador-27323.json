  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Sister restaurant of the Galeria 13 hostel, which is often closed. Many vegan/vegetarian choices - even finding one a rarity in this city, and almost impossible in this historic center. Owned by a guy from Norwich England who understands vegetarians' needs. Just ask the English-speaking staff for any help. Their \"amazing-and-crazy-hot\" chilli sauce doesn't contain fish, nor does their Thai sauce.",
