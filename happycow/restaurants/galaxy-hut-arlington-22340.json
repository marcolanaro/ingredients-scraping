  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Must be 21+ years old to enter. All veg but will serve meat upon request. Little retro diner, bar, and concert venue tucked away in the side streets of the Clarendon area. Began offering an all-veg menu in fall 2012; offers vegan choices for all dishes (BBQ sandwich, cheesteak, chili, fries, etc). The atmosphere is dark and slightly indie-dive-y. Art adorns the walls and you have the option of eating at several retro gaming tables. Live music nights. Opened another location in June 2012 called Spacebar in Falls Church.",
