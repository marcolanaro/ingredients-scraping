At lunch a basic plate or full plate is offered for 10 people til 2pm - better to reserve a space. Try the vegan ramen, which is MSG free and sugar free. Dinner is by reservation only, for minimum 2 up to 10 guests. Japanese dictionary or phrase book will be a big help if visiting this place for lunch or dinner, since chefs don't speak English.
