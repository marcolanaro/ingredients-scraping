  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Gift shop and a daytime cafe that's mostly lacto-vegetarian except for fish. Could make a dish vegan - for example request mango chutney instead of creme freche as a dip or ask to omit cheese in sandwich. Typical mains are spicy lentil, chickpea croquettes with salad, coconut curry with pita, hummus platter, sandwich, flapjacks. Keeps on stock soya milk, organic juices.",
