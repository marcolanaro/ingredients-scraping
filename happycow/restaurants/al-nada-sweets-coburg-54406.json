  "description": "A Middle Eastern bakery opened in 1978. Around 2010, it became a vegan bakery. All sweets made-in-house are vegan and include various types of baklava, lady fingers, bird nests and semolina cake. The biscuits in the window are vegetarian and are not made-in-house. A few tables inside and out the front of the small bakery but mostly take away.",
