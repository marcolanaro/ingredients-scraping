  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Winery restaurant located amid the scenic vineyards in the Ahr Valley. You have to find the Roman Villa in Ahrweiler, go up a rough track that goes up a steep hill, see signs for the Hohenzollern Hotel (turn left and go past there), keep going past 2 buildings and all the way to the end of the road. In 2015 it added several vegan dishes to its menu card, like stuffed peppers and fried zucchini with peanut sauce.\r\n",
