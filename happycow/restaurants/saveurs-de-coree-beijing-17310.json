  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A hip Korean restaurant, has a veg alternative for many menu items. Uses healthy ingredients. Staff are somewhat aware of vegans, but like most place in Beijing, do not offer soy milk as an alternative, though they do not use any milk or dairy in their food dishes, and in their dessert menu there's a chocolate mousse where tofu is used instead of dairy. Food is strictly MSG-free. They have a small Korean courtyard for al fresco dining. Chinese name is 韩香馆。 Previously located on Nanluoguxiang.",
