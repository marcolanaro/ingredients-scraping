  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. As with most non-veg Indian food restaurants, this place serves many different meats. But it has also a vegetarian section with around 12 dishes, plus there are veg options in appetizers and soups. Will cook without ghee (clarified butter) by request where possible. The lunch buffet is mostly vegetarian and vegan except for 2 options that include meat (chicken). Quiet.",
