  "description": "Traditional pub with an extensive vegetarian/vegan menu. A place for like-minded souls to come together for a good old knees-up. It's a bit like CBGB's crossed with Mallory Towers. Generous portions. Soups, risotto, nut roasts, and more, prepared by Chef Del Glover who previously worked for My Kitchen in Leigh before it closed. Children can visit, but not after 9pm.",
