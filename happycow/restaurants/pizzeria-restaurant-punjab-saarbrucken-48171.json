  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Indian food and pizza. Regular pizza dough contains milk and egg, but you could ask for a vegan version and omit cheese. The North Indian dishes are served with rice and chapatti (vegan suitable); some meals are vegan suitable like the alu palak, alu channa, and alu bharta - let your server know if you are veg/vegan. If you order one week in advance, the kitchen could make these vegan dishes: stew with lentils and peas, couscous, tabouleh, and bell pepper stuffed with soya chunks in tomato sauce and served with potato-wedges.",
