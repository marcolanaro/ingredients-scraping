  "description": "Walk east towards the lake, look for the pottery shop on the left side with the hand-painted sign \"Vegan Restaurant\" above the window. The pottery shop is owned by a vegan man who cooks meals each night for his friends and invites others to join for around 15RMB. There is no menu, and meals are at 7pm. Food is vegan and healthy (rice and vegetables) served Chinese style with dishes in the middle of the table for guests to take into their own rice bowl. Some nights the owner makes tofu and soymilk. Limited seating is in the small pottery shop with some more seating upstairs. The owner speaks some English.",
