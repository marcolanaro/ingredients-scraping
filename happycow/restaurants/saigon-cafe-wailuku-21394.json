A couple dishes contain egg (ie. egg noodle). Veg food include spring rolls, tofu with curry and lemongrass, stir fry flat rice noodle with tofu, hot and sour soup, etc. Directions: There's no visible signage and the location is actually at the corner of Lower Main St and Kaniela St, which are a bit hard to find. It's not on the main Main St, best to consult a map beforehead.",
