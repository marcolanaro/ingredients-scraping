  "description": "Vegetarian food stall at the market. Sells rice noodle salad, Vietnamese yellow pancakes, fried wheat noodles and vegetables. It's towards the north west corner of the market, near the edge of the food stalls. It is one of the few stalls to have white tiles on the wall behind, opposite a soft drink stand. The women who run it don't speak English but there's a menu in English you could point to. When asking locals, say \"mahope bua.\"",
