  "description": "The restaurant is quiet and bright. Offers a daily special. Vegans say \"sans queso, leche, y huevos\" (without cheese, milk, and eggs). Staff understands what vegan is. Uses egg on some dishes and must confirm upon ordering. Very little English spoken. The place is tucked in the Candelaria area, which is filled with students.",
