  "description": "Veggie fast food restaurant with several outlets in Belgium; this location opened April 2015. Greenway aims to introduce as many people as possible to its creative vegetarian cuisine because it is delicious, healthy and sustainable. Based on this tasty idea, Paul Florizoone launched the Greenway restaurant concept in Ghent in 1996. An idea so fresh that over the years, Greenway has grown into a trendsetter in vegetarian cuisine with restaurants in Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and Leuven.",
