  "description": "A vegetarian restaurant uses organic ingredients and local items as much as possible. Every week there are 3 different entrees; often one or two of the dishes also adjust to be vegan (beforehand as present, then there may be many). Meals can be ordered or you can walk into the store to see what there is. Besides the entrees, there is a daily changing selection of salads, pies, desserts, wines and others, some of which are vegan or can be made vegan; please inquire.\r\n",
