  "description": "結善緣素食滷味, located at 高雄市鼓山區華泰路230號, is a 'lu huay' style eatery. Basically there is a sliding glass case which holds many dishes. You open the door, and with tongs pick the gems you want and put them in your basket. The kitchen cooks (in water for stir fried) and seasons it for you, then tops your meal with pickled relish and basil. Small place with only a few tables.",
