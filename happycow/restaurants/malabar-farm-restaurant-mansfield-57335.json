  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. More upscale dining with view of the woods and a lake. Offers a few veg items - like fried mushrooms, house salad, tomato soup - but staff is accommodating, so specify if you are vegan. The pasta puttanesca can be requested vegan. Not on the menu but you could ask for the \"vegan plate\" which comes with grilled romaine, potatoes, and caramelized onion. ",
