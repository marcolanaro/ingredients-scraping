  "description": "Small cafe with a pleasant atmosphere, located inside Anokhi's textile store. Concise menu with mostly cold entrees and salads, both fusion and western style, prepared with mostly organic local ingredients. The few vegan items are clearly marked; desserts are not vegan. It's popular, so it may be crowded at lunchtime.",
