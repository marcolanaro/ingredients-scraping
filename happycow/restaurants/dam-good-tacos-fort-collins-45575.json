The tacos suitable for vegans are the one with sweet potato puree, kale, sliced almonds, tofu; and a Thai tofu taco with peanut sauce (coconut milk base). A few vegetarian tacos as well. The Greek taco has hummus, tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, and feta which could be substituted for tofu by request. Uses local veggies when available and cooks beans using water and sea salt (no lard).",
