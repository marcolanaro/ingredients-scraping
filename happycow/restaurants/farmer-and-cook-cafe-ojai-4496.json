  "description": "Vegetarian cafe and market with organic menu. Order at the counter and food is brought to your table. The day starts with muffins, scones, and breakfast scrambles (ovo, lacto - vegans must specify). At 11am the offerings are a salad bar with veggies grown organically on the cafe's own farm, two soups (one is vegan), grain and seed bread, and a menu with meals inspired by Mexican street food. Packaging used is compostable corn plastic, and the kitchen food scraps go back to the farm.",
