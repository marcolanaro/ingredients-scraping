  "description": "A 100% do-it-yourself volunteer-run collective that runs a bar, a movie theatre, a concert hall, a thrift store and (once a week) a restaurant. A three course meal is served every Friday around 18:30 for a price, but if you help with the dishes you eat for free. Meals are always vegetarian, sometimes vegan. It is not possible to make reservations.",
