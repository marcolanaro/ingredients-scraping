  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A booth at the food court at Boca Town Center Mall serving Chinese, Thai and Japanese cuisine. Vegetarian items are indicated on the menu and most are already vegan or can easily be made vegan. The Market Bar includes a bar of fresh vegetables and sauces to customize a stir fry dish, that is then cooked in front of you. Sauces that are vegetarian have a leaf next to the name, and if it is a clear sauce you can be sure that there are no eggs or dairy in it. Tofu is offered as a protein for the stir fry and vegans may get steamed or brown rice, or rice noodles.",
