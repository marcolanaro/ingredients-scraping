  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A small friendly/cozy pub with a predominantly vegan menu; an example from an April 2016 menu:  Both starters were vegan, and 5 of the 8 main dishes were vegan. All of the desserts are either vegetarian or vegan. Situated in the oldest surviving building in the city so access for pushchairs (buggies) and the like is a bit difficult; please ring in advance.",
