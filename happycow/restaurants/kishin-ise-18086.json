  "description": "Little vegan restaurant and deli in Ise, home to Japan's Shinto shrine. Menu available in Japanese and English. Offers a Japanese vegan lunch set that includes a main, tea and dessert. It's also a small shop selling soy products, sauces, etc. Kitchen stops at 5:30pm. May be difficult to find. Directions: Ujiyamada station is the closest stop on the Kintetsu line (not JR). As you head out of the station you go down the street to the right (look for the signs for \"the most famous restaurant in japan\") and keep going down that road, you should cross the rail way lines, and will see the restaurant soon after that, under a bridge on your left. Best to show the address to someone at the station and ask them to point you in the right direction.",
