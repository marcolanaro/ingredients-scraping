  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Mongolian style flat top grill/stir fry bar with choices of vegetables including tofu and a variety of sauces. Leave out the meats and just take veggies. You can also ask for the vegan broth to make your mix into a soup if you want. Vegetarians ask the kitchen to cook veggies off the main grill, in a wok, to avoid contamination. Dinner and weekend prices higher.",
