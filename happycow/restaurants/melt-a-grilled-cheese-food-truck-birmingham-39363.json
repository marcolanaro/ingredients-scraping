  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. As of June 2013, only place in the city to get a vegan grilled cheese sandwich, of which there are several. Knowledgeable about veganism. Chef takes care to keep the vegan orders away from any meat or dairy and is certain that they are buttered with olive oil instead of the standard butter. Has a rotating, daily specials menu. You can also build your own, choosing your own bread (vegan options), cheese (vegan cheese) and veggies (always fresh produce). Wi-fi. Often sets out a picnic table for seating.",
