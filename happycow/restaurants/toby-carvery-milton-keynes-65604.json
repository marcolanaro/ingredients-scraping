  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Chain of pub/restaurants - be warned that it's a carvery and is primarily meatstuff, but it's an option to go with non-veg diners. At lunch you will find around 4 vegetarian dishes, of which maybe 2 are vegan suitable. Could also order a few sides to make a meal, like roast potatoes, stuffing, apple sauce, etc. Ask about butter use. Gets busy at mealtimes.",
