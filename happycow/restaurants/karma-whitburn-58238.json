  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A dine-in/take-out Indian restaurant with an extensive vegetarian menu. Does not use ghee so almost all vegetarian dishes, other than paneer, are vegan, including curries, dahl, kable channa, saag aloo. Will also custom make vegan dishes. Please inform staff you are vegan, as some do not know what vegan means. As of Spring 2015, there are no other vegan choices in restaurants for miles, and even though they serve a lot of meat, it is the only choice.  ",
