  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. In 2015 this mountain restaurant located in Saint-Fran√ßois Longchamp got a new owner who is willing to promote a vegan lifestyle. You could order a vegan fondue (a specialty of the region, made of cheese, here with vegan cheese), a vegan pot au feu, and a chili sin carne. The menu also has vegan starters and desserts. In winter you could access the restaurant by ski (it is located along a ski slope named Le Marquis). If you don't ski or in the other seasons, you could go there by walking 30 minutes from the resort, or by 4x4. Open hours vary depending on the season, so check ahead.",
