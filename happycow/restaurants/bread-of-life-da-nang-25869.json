  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The purpose of this American-owned bakery and eatery is to support deaf people and to train and employ them in skilled labor positions. It is staffed almost entirely by deaf people. Profits also go toward education and medical care for the deaf community. The owners have made a significant effort to appeal to vegetarians. So while the menu has a full page of burgers, there is also a page of veggie entrees. While the menu does not have much in the way of vegan options the owners will make any changes to menu items that customers request. Directions: Located 2 doors from the roundabout at the junction of Dong Da, Bach Dang and 3 Thang 2 Streets.",
