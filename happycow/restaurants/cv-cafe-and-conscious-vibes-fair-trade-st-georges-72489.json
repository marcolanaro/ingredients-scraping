  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. A small cafe focused on organic, fair trade, and sustainable ingredients and merchandise. Offers a few vegan sandwiches, plus the owner is happy to make substitutions for vegans. Vegans can also get smoothies made with fresh fruit and almond milk or fruit juice, fair trade coffee (lattes made with almond milk) and other drinks. There's a cozy seating area to relax and catch up with free Wi-Fi for guests (one of, if not THE only Wi-Fi option in St Georges). Has a unique telephone booth library out front, where you can take a book for free, and they ask you to please replace it with another.",
