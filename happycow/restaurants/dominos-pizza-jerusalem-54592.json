When ordering online, scroll down to \"vegan zone,\" and you'll see 3 pizzas featured. One is a do-it-yourself, the other two are \"The Veg\" and \"Israeli\". Even though it says there that they are made with mozzarella, the order is marked vegan and vegan cheese only is on the pizza ordered. Online orders can be paid with PayPal.",
