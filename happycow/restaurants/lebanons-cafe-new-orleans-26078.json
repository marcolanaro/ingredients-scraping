  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Standard Middle Eastern fare ( hummus, falafel, baba ganuj, tabouli) but punctuated with more regional favorites like bathenjan, faul and musaha. Cheap veg sandwiches and more expensive entrees that come with salad (with vegan dressing), hummus and pita (choice of whole wheat or white). Try the Lebanese iced tea, sweetened or unsweetened flavored with rose water and pine nuts. Relaxed atmosphere.",
