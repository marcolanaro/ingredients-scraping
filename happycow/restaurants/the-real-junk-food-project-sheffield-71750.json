  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. This volunteer-run project operates on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday at Regather Works in Sharrow. The menu changes and is entirely made of waste and surplus food. Normally has at least one vegan dish, however as all the food is donated, this can't be guaranteed. Volunteers are generally clued-up about veganism. Pay as you feel.",
