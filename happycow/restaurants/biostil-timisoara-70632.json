  "description": "A health store located in Galeria 1 Mall, right next to Lulius Mall. Specializes in organic products - everything from organic nuts and seeds, flour and rice, deli and specialties, sweets and snacks, cosmetics and detergents, and also fresh organic produce. Has a good selection of vegan products that you can't get anywhere else in town, for example basil tofu and vegan whipped cream. Normally gets new products every Thursday, so it's better to visit in the next few days when the selection is wider. Please note they do sell meat.",
