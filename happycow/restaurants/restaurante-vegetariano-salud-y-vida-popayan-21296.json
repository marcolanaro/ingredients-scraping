  "description": "Offers a set lunch for 3000, which includes hot soup, salad, bean, brown rice, faux meat, and a small dessert. Items can be ordered separately as well, like fresh fruit juices and wholegrain cookies. Lunch is very crowded, but people don't linger long as the service is efficient. Colorful interior, several different rooms with a lot of seating. Dinner is same as lunch but with far fewer patrons.",
