  "description": "Offers organic, vegan, and healthful foods. Besides being the production facility for all meals sold at the various Choices cafes, it is also the springboard for all special entrees. The dining is communal, highlighting a plate of the day in tune with the seasons. A retail section features cold-pressed beverages, house-made dressing, and eco-friendly home products. Free Wi-Fi. Opened Apr 2014 near the Miami Airport, and shortly in the summer, its downtown cafe merged with this location.",
