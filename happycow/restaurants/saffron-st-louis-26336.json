  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Has a large vegetarian section on the menu that is mostly vegan. If a dish has creamy sauce, it is based with yogurt. Most food can be made vegan or vegetarian upon request. Many gluten free options. A nice sit down restaurant where a blazer or dress would not be out of place at dinner. The waiters are polite and knowledgeable about special diets.",
