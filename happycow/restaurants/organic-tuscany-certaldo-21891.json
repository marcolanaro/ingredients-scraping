  "description": "Organic Tuscany offers week-long \"farm to table\" organic cooking courses in the Tuscan hills. Four of the cooking courses are 100% vegetarian and the others are vegetarian friendly. Activities include visits to local organic farms, meeting the owners, eat in the farm restaurants, and taste their wines. Cooking classes are taught in English, but participants acquire a smattering of culinary Italian. Accommodation is in a beautiful villa with a panoramic view, in the grounds of the farm where the cooking classes are held.",
