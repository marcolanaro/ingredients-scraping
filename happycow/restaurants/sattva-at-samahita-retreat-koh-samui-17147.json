  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Yoga retreat center restaurant that serves mostly vegetarian food. All veg except for fish and eggs. No alcohol. Located on a quiet beach in the very southern part of Samui. A little tricky to find. Turn off the main road across from Waterfall #2 at 7-Eleven & police station (south) and continue until you come to an intersection with another 7-Eleven. Turn right and the small road to the center will be on your left.",
