  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Chain of pub/restaurants - be warned that it's a carvery and is primarily meatstuff, but it's an option to go with non-veg diners. As of Dec 2015 this location offers 3 marked vegan mains and 1 dessert. The drawback is you have to help yourself to vegetables from the carvery next to the meat. The roast potatoes are cooked in rapeseed oil. Ask about butter in the other vegetable dishes.",
