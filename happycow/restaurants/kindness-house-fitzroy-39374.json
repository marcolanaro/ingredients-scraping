  "description": "An incubator for growing NGOs that provides office facilities with modern technology, enabling those within the building to work more efficiently. Two-thirds of the Kindness House tenants only pay for their phone bills: rent and internet is free. Two amusing clauses in their leases. One, if you eat animals in the building, they kick you out. And two, if you have a dog, and you DONâ€™T bring the dog to the office, they kick you out.",
