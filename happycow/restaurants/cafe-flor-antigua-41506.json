  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. Vegan dishes are clearly marked. Most entrees can be made with tofu, and the menu explains when fish-based sauces are used. The word vegan isn't used, but the owner speaks excellent English and can answer any food questions. Located just off the main park; very easy to find.",
