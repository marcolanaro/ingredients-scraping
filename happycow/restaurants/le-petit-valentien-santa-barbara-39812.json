  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. The restaurant is French most of the week, but on weekends for lunch, it is veg-friendly because it's Ethiopian food (different chef from the French restaurant chef). A few vegan dishes on weekends from 11:30am-2:30pm. The French food is not veg-friendly though.",
