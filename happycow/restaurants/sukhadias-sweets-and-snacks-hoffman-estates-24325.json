  "description": "With two locations in Illinois, the other in Chicago, they are famous for their sweets; just a warning - many of them contain artificial coloring. Visited almost exclusively by Indian people and some of the staff don't understand English. Try the Kachori Chat, samosas, Sabji puri and masala tea. Served in plastic and has the feeling of fast food.",
