Carries lots of raw food products, vegan products, organic, vegan cleaning supplies and a few cosmetics like toothpaste, shampoo, etc. Does sell organic eggs and dairy products, but does not sell meat of any kind. Freezer products from The Vegetarian Butcher are available; try the vegan chicken substitutes. A salad bar is also available with pre-made salads. Offers refill options for most of the cleaning supplies and if you ask you can buy products in bulk.",
