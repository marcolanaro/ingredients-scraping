  "description": "Serves meat, veg options available. In business since before WWII and hidden away in the woods, this is a family run restaurant that serves traditional savoyarde food but these happen to include a number of ovo-lacto vegetarian items. No vegan options. You can get croutes with fresh picked forest mushroom sauce, local cheeses, local food. Selection of local wines. This is as \"real\" as it gets for French food. Reservations recommended due to popularity.",
