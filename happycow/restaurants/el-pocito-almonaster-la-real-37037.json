  "description": "EL POCITO is not a restaurant as such, it is a home and the site of a simpler living / sustainability project and forest garden. They welcome visitors any time, especially to share (no charge) their meals, which are all vegetarian (vegan by request). There is no charge but they ask you to bring some ingredients. Booking beforehand is also advised as they are a 2km walk from town, this can be done by email (monkeyandsofia@yahoo.co.uk, allow several days for them to check messages). Directions on their site.",
