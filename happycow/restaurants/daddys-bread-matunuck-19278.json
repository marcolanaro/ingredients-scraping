  "description": "Not a restaurant but a self-serve bakery stand. Offers vegan breads for around $5 per load. The bakery operates on the honor system, and there is a slot in which you insert your payment. If you don't have enough money, you can even leave an IOU to pay on your next visit. There are many vegan yeast bread and sweet bread vegan options, including blueberry-apple bread, pumpkin bread, johnnycake bread, garlic-dill bread. Over 15 bread varieties offered in the summer with fewer options in the winter. Go early before the bread sells out.",
